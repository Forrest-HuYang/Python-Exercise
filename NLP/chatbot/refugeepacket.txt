    Introduction to the Packet & Topic Analysis by
Richard Shmikler
       Welcome to the 2019 spring debate season! For this season, the students have chosen to discuss the exciting world of international refugee policy. Before we jump into the discussion, I want to invite any and all students interested in public speaking, debate, or international relations to engage in the new topic. On every topic, there is a steep learning curve, and certain ideas or vocabulary may be difficult at first, but with time and practice, you will find that not only do you have a firm grasp of the discussion as it relates to refugee policies, but your vocabulary, English speaking ability, critical thinking ability, and worldliness, will have improved drastically!
This packet offers some analysis of the topic wording and area, as well as evidence and suggestions on the core topics or issues within the literature (or within the debate surrounding refugee policy). This packet can serve as a great starting point for your preparation, and with the addition of some independent research, case-writing, drills, and work with your debate coach, tutor, and teammates, you will be on your way to success! While you can continue to explore the specifics of the wording, history, and arguments more in-depth throughout the packet, as well as find sample evidence, I will first offer some succinct overview explanations of the core ideas, history, and arguments to kick start your understanding.
If you find anything confusing, want additional explanations, or want to ask any questions that come to mind, you can feel free to reach out to me directly by either email at richardshmikler@yahoo.com or by WeChat @rshmikler. I am happy to answer any questions or respond to any comments you might have. All the arguments I am summarizing can be found in the footnoted articles or in the evidence packet itself, so while I did not footnote every argument or fact from a previously cited source, if you have any question about where I found evidence for an issue, feel free to contact me. Now let us explore the topic!

 Simplifying the Topic
Resolved: On balance, refugee restrictions in developed countries are permissible.
Refugees are generally understood as individuals who must leave their home country due to war or persecution, as is the United Nations understanding1. Think of someone whom, caught amid a civil war within their country, has their home and most of their town destroyed. Unable to survive in their current situation and without assistance from their own government, they are forced to flee. Someone in this situation is a “refugee”. “Developed countries” are countries with advanced economies, usually including the US, UK, Germany and most of the EU, China, Japan, and others. So, when we consider how this impacts the question of “refugee restrictions” we can see that the question here is relating to the limitations on developed countries accepting refugees from less developed, war-torn countries. In the context of the resolution, “permissible” means “allowable” or “okay”. Though you could argue that we are debating what is legally “permissible”, given that there is really no international body who enforces rules, and the question is more of a debate of what that international rule should be, we should probably understand the topic to be talking about moral “permissibility”.
To put it simply, the topic is saying: In general, it is okay for wealthier, more stable countries to deny access to those people fleeing war and violence in their home countries. Limitations you will encounter people advocating for include completely banning refugees, denying refugees from countries (particularly Middle Eastern countries), limiting where they can travel or work, but by far the most common limitation will be arguing for an extremely low number of accepted refugees, far below what is needed to alleviate the current refugee crisis. For instance, in the US in 2018, only 22,000 refugees were let in, while millions of refugees live in “temporary camps” around the world. It is important to note that “granting asylum” means agreeing to accept and host refugees, so “asylum seekers” are those who are looking to be hosted by a new nation2.

 Core Current Events
For you to understand the debates on this topic, and the articles you will encounter or find online, you should understand why this is such a big issue today. According to a 2018 report from the United Nations, 68.5 million people were forcibly displaced (forced from their home due to war or persecution) in 2018, with at least 25.4 million of them achieving UN refugee status, which is the highest number since World War Two3. As those declared “refugees” by the UN technically (and perhaps morally) deserve special protection under international law, many nations have responded to this refugee crisis, though to different extents and levels of effectiveness. While the majority of refugees are hosted by neighboring developing countries, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States are among the five developed nations accepting the most refugees. The United States and the United Kingdom give the most humanitarian and refugee aid/funding of any countries, and Germany and Sweden have admitted the most refugees seeking asylum of any industrialized countries outside of the Middle East.
While there are refugees coming from all parts of the world, there are five particular nations that the majority of refugees stem from. I will list each, and provide a small amount of background knowledge on the current situation:
Syria – Syria was the leading source of refugees in 2017. In 2011, peaceful protests began in Syria, inspired by the Arab Spring (a series of popular uprisings against authoritarianism throughout the Arab world). The government of Bashar al- Assad issued a large scale and violent crackdown, which spurred a civil war that has continued until this day. In a complicated web of alliances, the US supports the rebels; Russia and Iran support Assad; and ISIS (the terrorist group Islamic State) controls parts of northern and eastern Syria. An estimated 5.6 million people have fled Syria and another 6.3 million have been internally displaced. Most Syrian refugees are currently hosted in Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon.
Afghanistan – Afghanistan has faced a series of civil wars since being invaded by the Soviet Union in 1978. The refugee crisis expanded in 2001 when the Afghan government – backed by the US – fought a civil war against the Taliban. There was a further increase in refugees in 2017, when, likely in part due to US withdrawal from Afghanistan, there was a spur in Taliban and ISIS attacks. With the majority of the 2.6 million refugees being hosted by Pakistan, their future looks bleak, as Pakistan has begun returning asylum seekers to their war-torn homes.
South Sudan – The world’s youngest country, South Sudan is currently in a civil war that has been going on since 2013, when the country split between forces loyal to President Kiir and then-Vice President Machar. The resulting ethnic violence, food shortages, and humanitarian crisis has caused hundreds daily to flee to neighboring Uganda, who currently hosts 1.4 million refugees.
Myanmar – The Rohingya people, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, has been persecuted in the majority Buddhist country for decades. At the end of 2017, in response to an attack by Rohingya insurgents (resistance fighters to some, terrorists to others) the government engaged in a violent crackdown considered by the UN to be “a textbook example of ethnic

   11

 cleansing” or genocide. This resulted in 1.2 million refugees fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, who was ill prepared to receive them.
Somalia – Since 1991, when a civil war led to the overthrow of the military government of Siad Barre, Somalia has been one of the world’s poorest and most dangerous nations. Though an internationally supported government was instated in 2012, attacks by Shabab and Al Qaeda insurgents (terrorists to many) have maintained relative instability. In 2017, conflict in Somalia accounted for nearly 1 million refugees, mostly living in Kenya, Yemen, and Ethiopia.
This only touches the surface of these issues, but hopefully gives you a small understanding of the cause of the current refugee crisis and desperate situation that millions of people find themselves in today, largely because of civil wars. While it is crucial to understand how we got here, and how we can prevent more mass refugee problems in the future, the bigger question remains; what do we do now, with the largest number of refugees since World War Two?
12

 Debating on the Pro
Remember, the wording of the resolution is a little tricky, and the pro is arguing that refugee restrictions are permissible, so it is the con that will arguing for an increase of refugees and the responsibility of developed nations to accept them, while it is the pro who will argue that states have the rights to determine refugee policies themselves and that it is permissible, or okay for them to restrict refugees trying to enter their country. I will offer you some simple explanations of a few of the core arguments for the pro, many of which you can find specific evidence for in the packet, or through your own independent research.
Preserving Culture – a popular argument for closed borders is the importance of a country maintaining and protecting its own distinctive culture. That is, the country is justified in closing off the borders to protect the interests of its citizens in maintaining a historically rooted and identifiable identity. The argument goes that, if huge numbers of immigrants came into the country, they would change the culture of the receiving country in a rapid and dramatic way. It is important to consider how persuasive the counter-responses to this are. Will so many refugees come that it truly changes the culture? Who is to say that they won’t assimilate? And how does the right of a people to their culture compare to someone else’s right to safety?
Protecting the Economy – Based on the idea that the economy of a given country can only support so many workers, a massive influx of potential workers would mean that there would be a massive increase in poverty and joblessness, since people would find themselves unable to find work. This hurt will be felt most severely by the poorer, less skilled workers in the receiving country, as they will now have to compete with the large number of generally low-skilled laborers who enter as refugees and are willing to accept lower wages.
State Benefits – Many of the developed nations that could possibly accept refugees have extensive state benefits and welfare programs – funded through a long history of high tax paying citizens. This includes nations like Canada and Sweden, as well as most Scandinavian countries. If a large number of poor people tried to immigrate to these countries to reap the benefits of these systems, then there is no way that government could continue to guarantee these benefits to its citizens. Given the high number of refugees who need assistance, the government can either choose to provide all their guaranteed benefits, such as universal healthcare, or they can open their borders, but they can’t do both.
Security – You will find different statistics from Germany and other nations that show that an influx of refugees may lead to an increase in crime. You will also find many authors arguing that due to the origin of many of these refugees, being from countries with relatively high rates of terrorism, that there may be an increase in terrorism. While few will deny a state’s right to protect their citizens, I implore you to research how these crime studies are conducted, and whether racism or bias play a large role in their findings.
Self-Determination – Probably the core argument for the pro will be an argument about the states right to self- determination. If a state has the right to decide its own laws and who it associates with (or considers a citizen, friend, or
dependent) then it has the right to refuse entry to anyone. This argument can also take other forms. From the
  13

 democracy standpoint, given that the government is “by the people, for the people” and refugees were not part of the political process, they should not be subject to its laws and restrictions. Another angle is the realism argument. Realism argues that states are not moral bound because morality is essentially based on contracts between individuals, but since there is no higher power that can enforce a contract on a state, they are not bound to any contract except for that between them and their citizens. This notion, based on social contract philosopher Hobbes, would argue that the state is permissible in taking any action towards an outsider, including refugees.
Alternative Options – The last argument I will mention is about the possibility of helping through alternative options. While it may be the moral duty of a state to help refugees, perhaps they can do this without actually opening up their borders to refugees. This could include such options as giving large amounts of aid to refugees, paying developing neighboring countries to host the refugees instead, or even restrict refugees for now while they instead invest money, energy, and perhaps even military force into helping to solve the issues that create refugees in the first place.
14

 Debating on the Con
When debating as the con, you will be arguing that it is not the case that “On balance, refugee restrictions in developed countries are permissible”. In other words, you will be arguing that it is not okay for wealthy nations to limit or reject refugees trying to enter their country. While the arguments for the con will tend to be fewer, in general, I think that they are often more persuasive. There are millions of people who have nowhere to go, who have been displaced in their home country, and will likely die or suffer in huge numbers without assistance. Here, I will outline some of the key arguments for the con side of this debate.
International Law – This may be the easiest argument to make on the con, though how important we should consider this issue will be the harder part of the debate. Multiple international conventions (or laws and agreements) require countries to care for refugees, including the Refugee Convention under the United Nations, the International Humanitarian Law, the International Human Rights Law, International Refugee Law, etc. Most developed nations have signed these agreements, and therefore seem legally obliged to help in some regard. Whether that means no restrictions on refugees, or to what extent a state should consider themselves required to abide by these contracts, is less clear. Additionally, perhaps being pro doesn’t just mean that developed nations can restrict refugees now, but that all existing laws pertaining to refugees should be changed.
Humanitarianism – Arguably the most persuasive argument for the con, developed nations have a duty to protect refugees in order to protect their human rights. It could be easily argued that people have a right to security, safety, shelter, or at minimum life, and that someone should not lose those rights merely because they lost “the lottery of birth”. Where someone is born is random, and refugees fleeing persecution are not in their situation due to any moral, economic, or other failure, but rather just because of bad luck and an inability to do anything. If millions of people, children even, will ultimately die or suffer tragically unless developed nations take them in, don’t those nations have an obligation to help? At the end of the day, are not all lives equally valuable, whether they are from America, China, Syria, or Sudan?
Libertarianism – Libertarianism is a term you might recognize from previous topics. Essentially, the idea is that the most important types of rights or protections are those of the individual. Libertarians generally argue for minimalist governments, or governments that focus on providing security and justice primarily, while all other things are minimized to allow more personal freedoms. Not only does limiting refugees limit the individual freedoms of those seeking asylum from outside a country, but restrictions also limit those within a country. One example is limiting the freedom of movement of refugees within a society or limiting where they can work. Another example is limiting a citizen’s right to hire laborers or sell property to a refugee, which limits their economic freedom and right to personal property.
Influence – Influence is the ability of a country to change or affect another country’s situation. I will frame this argument in three ways. First, developed countries have the greatest position to influence the lives of refugees, when compared to developing nations. They have more money and more resources, and since someone should help refugees somehow, they should be the ones to do it. Second, developed nations who wish to increase their influence, be it to spread ideas relating to good governance, values, or ethical politics, should do so be protecting those less fortunate and working to15
  
 gain greater reputation and status in the world. Many have argued for this in terms of China’s involvement with the refugee crisis, claiming that for China to be considered an international leader by other nations, they should rise to help solve this international problem. Thirdly, at least to some extent, many blame different developed nations for the negative influence they had on many of the countries where refugees come from. For example, the refugees in Syria were largely displaced by the Russia-backed Assad government, and there was a massive increase in refugees in Afghanistan partly due to the US withdrawal of military forces. Perhaps due to this influence, developed nations have a responsibility to help with the unintended consequences.

 Conclusion
There are a lot of directions you can go with this topic, and I encourage you to not only read the evidence and analysis provided in this packet, but also do your own research and find creative ways to argue for both sides. Due to the current refugee crisis, this is a very relevant and important issue, and properly dealing with refugees in the future will be important as the world is sure to see more mass migrations. This topic provides you a great opportunity to debate about the impacts of policies and understand the politics of the world, as well as explore moral philosophy and the ideas behind international relations. This topic is a great “best of both worlds” debate, discussing both real-world policies, and also different abstract philosophies.
To begin your research, I suggest you look through this brief and when you find evidence you like, read the article it is from. You can look at the articles I have footnoted in this short topic analysis to do some more general research as well. After that, use smart search terms on your favorite search engines and academic journals. Look up things like “refugee crisis”, “refugee restrictions”, “international refugee law”, or even “international relations theory”. Your coach should be able to guide you on more search terms, or you can feel free to reach out to me directly with additional questions. I am happy to answer any question now or later as you do research, so feel free to add me and say hello! When it comes to doing independent research and starting on the topic, the only bad decision is not starting at all!
I wish you all luck on the new debate season! Remember, the majority of debates are won before the debate ever begins, in the research, drills, and preparation you did before the tournament. While I do hope luck is on your side, don’t worry about it too much. Real champions don’t rely on luck – they choose well.
  Best,
Coach Richard Shmikler

    Topic Overview by Stefan Bauschard
     18

 Introduction
Legally and morally, governments have obligations to refugees as well as a right to control their borders. One of the way governments do that is by restricting immigration. These obligations are very well established in political theory, legal tradition, and ethical scholarship.
These legal and moral obligations stem from practical concerns related to protecting a country’s economic interests and its security from physical threats.
The essential question the resolution asks is whether these conceptual and practical interests outweigh other competing interests – legal and ethical obligations to refuges, as well as practical potential benefits that might stem from letting more refugees into the country.
In this essay, we will unpack some of the key terms in the resolution, discuss political and ethical theories that underlie the debate, identify key arguments for both sides, and conclude with some arguments you can make on each side as to which one outweighs.
To contextualize the obligations that governments have to refugees, it is also important to understand the current refugee crisis and what it means for someone to be a “refugee.”
There are currently 68 million refugees on the move world-wide, constituting the largest refugee crisis since World War II.
Lauren Crow, December 19, 2018, https://www.economist.com/the-world-in/2018/12/19/how-to-alleviate-the- refugee-crisis How to alleviate the refugee crisis
   The number of refugees worldwide has climbed for six consecutive years. Some 68m people are now displaced by violence and persecution—equal to a fifth of the population of America, nearly half that of Russia and more than the entire population of Britain. At the same time, humanitarian support is chronically underfunded. As of September 2018 the United Nations’ refugee agency, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (unhcr), and its partners had received just 31% of the funds they needed to provide basic assistance to millions of Syrian refugees and displaced people. The same dire situation exists elsewhere too, with less than half the amount of humanitarian funds needed in the vast majority of conflict-affected countries. If nothing is done, this trend of growing numbers and scarce resources will continue, with severe consequences, in 2019. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. This is not a sustainable situation. The answer does not lie in countries adopting harsh unilateral measures that target refugees and that run counter to humanitarian values and responsibilities. That will only inflame the problem. Instead, we must reduce the number of displaced people worldwide by preventing and solving the conflicts that drive them from their homes. We must rally people and countries to act together based on common interests and universal aspirations for security, dignity and equality. This does not have to come at the expense of our safety and economic well-being at home, but is an essential requirement when facing problems of international dimensions. Rights, funding, action Let’s look at the facts. First, 85% of all refugees live in low- and middle-income countries. Most people who are displaced by violence remain within the borders of their own countries. Those who are forced out tend to stay as close as they can to home, in neighbouring nations. Less than 1% of all refugees are resettled, including in Western countries. The world’s poorer countries are bearing the brunt of the burden. We cannot assume that they will continue to do this irrespective of policies in wealthier nations. If the number of refugees grows, as it probably will in 2019, so too will the tension this imbalance causes unless we do a better job of sharing responsibility. Second, for all the generosity of taxpayers in the West and all the lives that are saved by this, the billions of
             19

 dollars in humanitarian aid provided annually do not come close to meeting the needs of 68m forcibly displaced people, let alone if the numbers keep growing.
   Despite the growth in the number of refugees, countries around the world are restricting the number of refugees they admit.

Europe and the U.S. have seen a recent rise in anti-immigrant sentiment that has fueled policies seeking to keep out refugees and migrants. Why it matters: As the number of displaced people worldwide continues to grow, the burden of caring for refugees is increasingly falling on developing nations. And resettlement to wealthier nations "is a solution that is genuinely and urgently needed by more people than there are places for them made available by governments," Chris Boian, spokesperson for UNHCR, told Axios. Show less "There are actions and behaviors and border restrictions that are taking place around the world that would not be taking place
        around the world without the influence — and dare I say leadership — of the Trump administration." — Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International and former assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, told Axios. Americans are more likely to say they want fewer immigrants admitted to the U.S. than more, according to a new Pew Research survey. But the sentiment is much more strongly seen in European countries — more than 70% of Italians, Greeks and Hungarians said they think their nations should allow fewer immigrants in. In the U.S., President Trump has cut the refugee cap two years in a row. Just 22,000 refugees were admitted in fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30 — the lowest number in more than 40 years. The
       CNN adds --
The world's six wealthiest countries host less than 9% of the world's refugees, according to a new Oxfam report. While the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France and UK make up more than half the global economy, last year they only hosted 2.1 million refugees and asylum seekers -- just 8.88% of the world's total, the aid organization said in its report released Monday (CNN, July 18, 2016 Oxfam: Poorest nations shouldering responsibility for the world’s refugees. http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/18/world/oxfam- richest-countries-refugees/)
Practically speaking the resolution asks the simple question of whether or not the restrictions that have been placed on the movement of these millions of refugees to the developed world are permissible

 What are “Refugees”?
   There is certainly a debate about how “refugees” should be defined. Defining them is important because “refugees” are entitled to certain legal claims and resources under various international legal conventions that will be discussed in more detail later and because you want to be able to focus your arguments.
Under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, a refugee is someone who has been granted asylum, however the UN considers individuals fleeing persecution or war to be refuges, even if they have not yet obtained asylum.
All individuals who are moving to improve the quality of their lives are not refugees, they are migrants. Refugees are limited to those persons fleeing war or persecution.
Jeanne Park, September 23, 2015, Europe’s Migration Crisis, https://www.pravo.unizg.hr/_download/repository/semiunar_migrants.docx
An asylum seeker is defined as a person fleeing persecution or conflict, and therefore seeking international protection under the 1951 Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees; a refugee is an asylum seeker whose claim has been approved. However, the UN considers migrants fleeing war or persecution to be refugees, even before they officially receive asylum. (Syrian and Eritrean nationals, for example, enjoy prima facie refugee status.) An economic migrant, by contrast, is person whose primary motivation for leaving his or her home country is economic gain. The term “migrant” is seen as an umbrella term for all three groups. (Said another way: all refugees are migrants, but not all migrants are refugees.))
  Once someone is properly designated a refugee, he or she is entitled to asylum in another country under principles of international law. He or she has a right to receive membership somewhere and not to be returned (the right of non- refoulement).
 Max Cherem, September 29, 2015, assistant professor of philosophy, has been appointed as the Marlene Crandell Francis Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Journal of Political Philosophy, Refugee Rights: Against Expanding the Definition of a “Refugee” and Unilateral Protection Elsewhere, p. 1-23 DOI: 10.1111/jopp.12071
Having moved past the humanitarian definition’s interest-based conception of refugee rights, I conclude by showing why protection elsewhere schemes do not allow legitimate states to permissibly achieve the unilateral exclusion of all outsiders, including refugees. The core of refugee law isn’t simply about meeting a certain kind of need. It is also about avoiding a specific wrong: returning people to persecution. Contrary to popular misconceptions, refugees do “not have a right to admission as such, but rather a right to protection which includes the right to non-refoulement.” Refugees cannot be sent back. They must receive membership somewhere. But, beyond the state where they flee, they can be protected by another state that agrees to accept them as members. The difference between refraining from refoulement and granting new membership is key to protection elsewhere schemes. By relying on this difference such schemes distinguish
between respecting versus protecting or fulfilling rights. Following standard terminology, we can say rights claims must be reasonably secured to be enjoyed. To secure rights, actors must discharge three correlative duties: (i) avoid depriving people of their rights, (ii) protect people from being so deprived, and (iii) aid people who are deprived. These duties can fall on different actors. While everyone has duties to respect rights, only certain actors have duties to protect specific persons against deprivations and fulfill their rights if deprived.
           21

 Governments may have duties to respect, protect, and fulfill rights of those in their jurisdiction, but merely duties to respect outsiders’ rights.
 Pro teams will want to emphasize this limited definition of “refugee” – someone fleeing war or persecution -- because it means they are not simply arguing for higher levels of immigration for millions (maybe even more than a billion) people simply seeking to improve their quality of life.
 22

 Developed World/Restrictions/Permission
There are few wording issues that need to be tackled.
Refugee restrictions. There are couple of different things that can be meant by “refugee restrictions.”
First, “refugee restrictions” can refer to the caps developed countries place on the number of refugees that can enter their countries. The total number of refugees that countries are accepting each year is generally decreasing and I think this is what the writers of the resolution meant for you t debate about.
Second, “refugee restrictions” could refer to restrictions refugees face once they are admitted to a country. For example, maybe refugees cannot access certain social services that citizens cannot. Pro teams could argue for lifting those particular restrictions.
Developed countries. The definition of a “developed country” is vague, but it includes more advanced economies --
Canadian Development Agency, https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/entrepreneur-toolkit/templates-business- guides/glossary/pages/developed-country.aspx
A developed country—also called an industrialized country—has a mature and sophisticated economy, usually measured by gross domestic product (GDP) and/or average income per resident. Developed countries have advanced technological infrastructure and have diverse industrial and service sectors. Their citizens typically enjoy access to quality health care and higher education.
So, the general question the resolution asks is whether or not countries with more “advanced economies” should accept refugees from countries with “less advanced” economies.
It is certainly the case that the refugees are fleeing from “less advanced” economies, which would be a generous description of those economies. Many of the economies the refugees flee from have completely collapsed. We don’t see significant debate over whether or not the refugees are fleeing from less advanced economies.
On the other hand, there may be some debate about what economies are “developed.” The United States clearly counts, and so does Canada, Germany, the UK, and Japan. But are China examples relevant? Is Saudi Arabia a developed country? Since Public Forum debaters don’t read plans, the details of every country will not matter, but they could be relevant when discussing particular examples.
Permissible. I think “permissible” is the strangest term in the resolution and could set up some interesting debates.
“Permissible” literally means to have the to do something. For example, I could give you the permission to skip your homework.
In the context of the resolution, there are three ways to look at the term.
First, whether or not the restrictions are legally permissible. Although countries do have some obligations under international law to accept refugees, those legal agreements do not specify a number of refugees and I think any Con team would have great difficulty arguing that the existing restrictions are not legally permissible. Some creative Pro teams may try this approach.
  23

 Second, there is a question of whether or not restrictions are ethically permissible. Con teams could argue they are not.
Third, there is a question of whether or not the restrictions are desirable. I think this is the question the authors of the resolution meant for everyone to debate, and I think it is the one that may end up being debated, but I’m not sure how the resolution asks it. Nonetheless, I’d be prepared for a debate about the desirability of accepting more refugees.
As a final note, I think it is worth pointing out that the resolution requires the Pro to defend the status quo. This is a bit odd for this type of resolution, but it is what it is.
  24

 Realism, Idealism, and Foreign Policy
Underlying the debate about whether obligations toward refugees outweigh a state’s right to control its own borders is the question of how a country should approach the world. Should countries be concerned (mostly) with their own national interests and rely on themselves to solve problems, or should they be concerned with more international interests and embrace more international solutions?
  Advocates of acting exclusively in the “national interest” ground their arguments in the tradition of foreign policy realism. Realists argue that countries will inevitably act out of self-interest and that countries should act out of self-interest.
Realists argue that the US should only look out for its immediate security and economic interests. Foreign policy realists draw on the 14th century works of Niccolo Machiavelli, the 15th century works of Thomas Hobbes, and the 16th century work of Rosseau. These philosophers argued that human beings are inherently self-interested, that many humans are evil, that interests are often zero-sum, and that centralized power is often necessary to control impulses. Hence, international politics always exists in a “state of war” or “anarchy” and governmental actors should always look to protect the national interest. In adapting the works of these philosophers to foreign policy, realists make a number of statements which they say describe the nature of the international system:
 - Some leaders are inherently evil and lust for power
- Leaders of states act to promote the self-interest of the state
- Resources are scarce and interests are often zero-sum
- States are primarily interested in “self-help”
- States will act in their own self-interest
- States will always act to counterbalance the relative power gains of other states
- The nation state is the “primary unit of analysis.” Understanding the action of individuals or private groups is not
important to understanding foreign policy.
 Leading realist theorists include Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, Robert Jervis, and George Kennan (among others)
Writing in 1950, Hans Morgenthau argued that states need to look out for their own interest and protect their own
power because (a) governments have an obligation to their own citizens, (b) protecting power protects future generations, (c) there is no effective international system to otherwise protect the interest of states; and (d) if the national interest is not protected the state will eventually collapse, making it impossible to protect any other interest.( (The American Political Science Review, The Mainsprings of American Foreign Policy: The National Interest v. Moral Abstractions, p. 853-ff)
For these scholars, a nation should probably not do something like provide protection to refugees if such action threatened its national interest, as defined as protecting its power and long-term survival.
Idealists argue that the US is responsible for protecting broader principles. It is important to understand that realists came under attack in the 1980s from their liberal opponents on the grounds that liberalism could not exchange the more peaceful evolution of the international system at the end of the cold war.
The liberal perspective stands in opposition to the realist perspective on international relations. Liberals find their philosophical foundation in the 15th century writings of John Locke and the 16th century writings of Immanual Kant. According to the theorists who applied these philosophical writings to foreign policy, foreign policy should reflect the rights and duties of individuals. These scholars believe that it is potential to “cultivate” a foreign policy “garden” and to
 25

 have peaceful relations between states where states don’t perpetually act out of self-interest to balance against each others interests. Foreign policy idealists usually endorse at least some of the following tenants:
-Political constraints impact on foreign-policy decision-making. Self-interest of the state does not determine foreign policy outcomes
-Fostering interdependence amongst states and building multilateral institutions can facilitate cooperation rather than self- interest
-Most states are not interested in balance of power politics, but rather on solving problems and avoiding conflict Specific criticisms of realism include:
-Lack of ability to define the “National Interest.”
-Doesn’t explain problems conflicts that cross the boundaries of nation-states: environmental pollution, refugees.
-Most contemporary problems trade, multinational investment, migration, environmental are more likely to find solution through international cooperation than war.
-Terrorism is an emerging threat that is not directed against particular states.
-Realism does not explain contemporary phenomenon why did Russia allow its empire to break up if states are completely focused on power?
Liberal internationalist argue that we should embrace international laws, conventions, and norms in order to strengthen the multilateral international system. There are many such laws and conventions relevant to refugees, and, hence, a claim that a country should prioritize its obligations to provide a safe haven for refugees over securing its own borders is, fundamentally, grounded in an idealist international political theory.

 Size of the Refugee Problem, Lack of Current Solutions Environmental problems will worsen the refugee crisis
Andre Freedman, December 15, 2018, https://www.axios.com/climate-change-refugees-are-already-on-the-move- d17b190c-122b-4e1f-9021-8ca666bf3880.html Climate change is already deepening the refugee crisis
The U.S. military views climate change as a threat multiplier, one that is likely to worsen already existing weaknesses of government and poverty. Why it matters: Internal and external climate displacement is already occurring. Depending how quickly and significantly temperatures rise, the specter of climate migration and refugee flows looms large by midcentury. Show less Rising seas: In 2017 alone, nearly 19 million new internal displacements were recorded in more than 130 countries worldwide, largely triggered by extreme weather events such as floods and tropical cyclones, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. That's more than were displaced due to armed conflict in the same year, and climate change is aggravating many of these extreme weather events. Residents of small island nations like the Marshall Islands, Vanuatu and Kiribati are fleeing rising tides and powerful storms to seek better economic opportunities in the U.S. mainland and elsewhere. Other small island countries are wrestling with contingency plans should waters rise too high. A recent U.N. climate report found that many low-lying island states will face an existential threat should global warming exceed 1.5°C, or 2.7°F, above preindustrial levels by 2100. On our present course, we're headed for more than 3°C, or 5.4°F, above preindustrial levels by the end of the century. Such scenarios could even spur millions of Americans to migrate away from the coast, too. Elsewhere, sea level rise and the monsoon season have pushed populations inland in heavily populated Bangladesh, as Rohingya refugees are forced to settle in marginal areas vulnerable to flooding. Drought: In addition to sea level rise, water stress is the biggest concern of humanitarian groups and military planners. By making droughts hotter and drier, the threat of drought induced migration and conflict is growing in areas that are vulnerable to social and military strife. Climate studies have tied the Syrian Civil War's beginnings in part to a record drought that struck the Fertile Crescent in 2007- 2010, which set in motion political events that set the country on a ruinous course. That drought, climate models show, was made more likely and severe due to global warming. Precise NASA satellite measurements of groundwater storage — which acts as a water savings bank for farmers — show water stress building in heavily populated and conflict- prone parts of the world: Places like the border region between Pakistan and India, the Fertile Crescent, and the Northwest Sahara Aquifer System, which provides water for Algeria, Tunisia and war-torn Libya. The big picture: The locations most at risk from climate change-related stresses in the near-term includes heavily populated areas like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and extends around the world to parts of South America and Africa, encompassing well over a billion people. The bottom line: No refugee crisis or migration flow is purely due to climate change. But already, global warming-related factors are playing a role in setting people into motion, both within countries and between.

 Lots of Restrictions on Refugees Now

 Definitions -- Refugees
 Migrant, refugee, asylum seeker
Rick Kelsy, January 9, 2019, https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-46747502 Asylum seekers, migrants or refugees: Which word is correct?
Migrant
The term you might hear most often. This is a person who moves from one place to another, in order to find work or better living conditions. So if you live in the UK and decide to head off to work in Spain for a few months this summer, you could be described as a migrant. Charlotte Taylor says a migrant can be a safe term: "It is at the moment, but it won't necessarily continue to be a safe term. They change over time". Where it gets a bit more tricky is political migration. This can be when someone moves to get away from a certain regime. Charlotte does have concerns about words used around migration such as "wave, flow, flooded by". She believes this type of language can mean people in a country where migrants are regularly arriving can see them as "products not people". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was criticised in 2015 for talking about "a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain". Immigrant This is when a person comes to live permanently in a foreign country. They don't have to have been forced from or pushed out of their own country, it can be a choice. There is something very different about an illegal and legal immigrant, however valid the reasons for movement. One has been allowed to come to a country through approved documents - an illegal immigrant has not. Charlotte Taylor says media in the UK often discuss immigration and not emigration, which is when people leave their home country. "Emigration has nearly dropped out of conversation," she says. She thinks, despite an improvement in tone over the last 30 years, it's partly down to some hostility towards immigration. "They are now seen as really separate processes. People don't recognise the similarities."
Refugee
A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster. "It's a very different kind of status," says Dr. Charlotte Taylor. "As soon as you acknowledge someone is a refugee you acknowledge they have a certain set of rights. "They have been driven by circumstances beyond their control." Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption A group rescued in the Mediterranean Sea
Asylum seeker
This person could be a combination of all of the above, although they are asking for international protection in another country. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid questioned whether people in boats travelling from France to the UK were genuine asylum seekers earlier this month. Some political opponents and campaigners said his comments were "deeply concerning". Mr Javid's argument was that some of the people were coming from France - which is deemed a safe country - rather than their place of origin. Asylum seeker is the term Charlotte feels comfortable with using for people coming on these small, often unsafe, boats across The Channel. "If someone is seeking asylum, they are seeking asylum. "I was very surprised to see that distinction between genuine and non-genuine asylum. It may be rejected but the seeking [part] is a fact." EU rules allow a country such as the UK to return an adult asylum seeker to the first European country they reached. Asylum seekers often say they want to come to the UK because they want to speak English, and because they have family connections in the country.
Women seeking domestic violence as refugees but it is hard to prove they meet the definition of a “refugee”

 Tamara Wood, Centre Affiliate, Andrew and Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW, January 9, 2019, Are women escaping family violence overseas considered refugees? https://theconversation.com/are-women- escaping-family-violence-overseas-considered-refugees-109509
Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun’s story has travelled around the world this week, highlighting Saudi Arabia’s repressive treatment of women and that not only those who seek asylum by sea face perilous journeys to safety. For now, al-Qunun remains in Thailand, and it’s been reported the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) has deemed her to be a refugee. Australia has said it will consider granting her asylum. Reports say al-Qunun fears, if she is returned to Saudi Arabia, she will be abused and killed by her family for renouncing Islam and asserting her independence. Sadly, al-Qunun’s fear of being harmed by those closest to her is not unique. Worldwide, an estimated 35% of women have experienced family or domestic violence. In some countries, the figure is closer to 70%. Not all those at risk will be entitled to international refugee protection, however. Only those who meet the definition of a “refugee” can make a valid claim for asylum. Women fleeing family and domestic violence must deal with a unique range of legal and practical hurdles before the threat of being returned will truly have passed. Refugee protection for gendered violence The international refugee convention of 1951 defines a “refugee” as a person outside their own country who fears persecution because of their race, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Read more: Explainer: how Australia decides who is a genuine refugee This legal definition was devised in Europe in the aftermath of the second world war, primarily with the political refugee in mind. Although the convention isn’t limited to those fleeing political persecution, women fleeing gender-based violence must overcome a number of hurdles to show they meet the definition’s criteria. The most fundamental requirement for refugee protection is that the applicant be outside her country of origin. This alone precludes most women from accessing international protection. The cost of travel and the danger it entails – women and girls face heightened risks of sexual violence, trafficking and exploitation during their journeys – make seeking asylum a dangerous endeavour. For women living under repressive regimes such as in Saudi Arabia, where permission to travel is required from a male guardian, leaving the country may be impossible. For those who do leave, trying to prove they are at risk of persecution poses further challenges. A refugee must be outside her home country when seeking asylum, which precludes many women from applying. WAEL HAMZEH/AAP Beyond obvious physical signs of mistreatment, obtaining evidence of domestic violence is notoriously difficult. In most refugee cases, the primary means of establishing the applicant’s claim to asylum is her testimony. Lasting effects of trauma, potentially significant cultural and language barriers, and being surrounded by often male interpreters, decision-makers and legal representatives, can make the burden of proof for such women overwhelming. Moreover, the refugee definition itself was not designed with the experiences of women in mind. In cases like al-Qunun’s, failure to conform to religious expectations will likely play a role. But the tendency of refugee status decision-makers has been to see violence by family members as a private matter, and not attributable to one of the five grounds of persecution: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group and political opinion. When refugee claims involving family and domestic violence succeed, it is usually on the basis women may constitute a particular social group. Accepting that women in a particular country constitute a particular social group allows refugee status decision-makers to provide protection to women who fear persecution because they are women. The UNHCR states that women are a clear example of a social group “defined by innate and immutable characteristics, and who are frequently treated differently than men”. Read more: Do abused women need asylum? 4 essential reads However, the worldwide prevalence of family and domestic violence, coupled with concerns about “opening the floodgates” to women seeking asylum, have seen this approach to gender-based refugee claims rejected on a regular basis.
Refugee” as defined by the Convention and interpreted by other authorities

 European History, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, Berkeley Journal of International Law, The Evolving Definition of the Refugee In Contemporary International Law, p. 95-8
The beginning for any inquiry into the definition of a refugee is the Refugee Convention and its protocol. 1 The Refugee Convention specifies that a person qualifies as a refugee if (1) the person has already been considered a refugee under prior treaty arrangements 2 or (2) the person is outside the country of his nationality (or not having a nationality) and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. 3 The latter are commonly referred to as the "inclusion" clauses. Failure to qualify under the former does not defeat the possibly of qualification under the latter. 4
This Article will not address in depth the requirements of persecution or social group membership, other than to note in passing that the classification of social group membership appears to be broadening to consider cultural changes. 5 Also one of the most significant developments in interpretation is that some states have begun to recognize non-state actors as potential sources of persecution, rather than only states. 6 These two developments suggest that at least the applicable inclusion provisions within the definition of refugee appear to be interpreted dynamically with a focus on the object and purpose of the Refugee Convention, and the contemporary meaning of the treaty tex
However, there are also several provisions that defeat refugee status for otherwise qualified individuals. Individuals who do qualify under (1) or (2) above may fall outside the definition if they have voluntarily re-availed themselves of the protection of their country of nationality; 7 have voluntarily re-acquired the nationality of their state; 8 have acquired a new nationality and protecting state; 9 or voluntarily re-established themselves in the state which they left or remained outside of owing to fear of persecution. 10 In the case of multiple nationals, the individual must qualify as a refugee as per all the states of nationality. 11 This latter possibility has been interpreted so far as to refuse refugee status to persons who have the potential nationality (perhaps even ethnicity) of another state. 12 However, this dual nationality (or residence) provision is not always strictly applied under municipal law, evidencing a purposive application of the terms of the convention. For example, North Koreans who avail themselves of South Korean nationality are considered firmly resettled in South Korea by the United States, 13 but if they do not move to acquire South Korean nationality, they cannot be returned to the Korean peninsula on the theory that they could be considered South Korean nationals
Persons will also not qualify if the persecuting circumstances within the relevant state have ceased to exist under the so- called "cessation" clauses 15. According to the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the cessation clauses are to be applied sparingly. Further, in order to invoke a cessation clause:

DOA: 4-21-16
The term ‘refugee’ describes people who are outside their countries of origin and are legally entitled to international protection. In this paper, we use the term to cover both refugees who meet the definition under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees (‘Convention refugees’) and ‘subsidiary protection beneficiaries’ under EU and international human rights law. A Convention refugee is someone who ‘owing to well- founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.’ A subsidiary protection beneficiary is someone who is not a Convention refugee but who may not be returned to their countries as she faces ‘serious harm’ if returned, namely the death penalty or execution; torture, inhuman or degrading treatment; and some individual risks from indiscriminate violence in conflict. 32

 Some people may be excluded from these statuses, for instance war criminals and those who have perpetrated genocide. However, no one may be returned to face torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, as this prohibition is absolute in international human rights law. While governments often use the term ‘refugee’ to refer only to those who have been recognized as such after an asylum procedure, in international law refugee status is declaratory, so ‘refugees’ are refugees ‘as soon as they fulfil the criteria in the definition.
Climate migrants don’t meet the definition of a “refugee” under the 1951 Refugee Convention
Abdikarim Ali, M.A. in Public & International Affairs, & B.Soc.SC with Honors in Conflict Studies and Human Rights, April 2015, Climate-Induced Migrants, International Law, and Human Rights, http://environmentalmigration.iom.int/climate-induced- migrants-international-law-and-human-rights-assessment DOA: 10-7-15
As the planet’s ocean and seawaters continue to rise, coastal land becomes inundated, staple crops are destroyed by salinity intrusion, ecosystems are decimated or altered due to salt toxicity, and human populations are forcibly displaced.i The resulting displaced persons, safely referred to as climate-induced migrants, either become internally displaced persons (IDP’s) within their borders or cross international borders as a means of survival.ii Legally these migrants fall outside the rigid framework of the International Legal Regime for the protection of refugees. Unfortunately the plight of these climate-induced migrants is not aligned with the scope and definition of the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is upheld by Article 14 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which acknowledges the right of persons to seek refuge and or asylum from persecution in other countries.ccxvii With the 1951 Convention, and 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of refugees in mind, the classification of climate-induced migrants as refugees, cannot be justified under international refugee law due to the absence of persecution.
There is a difference between a “colloquial” definition of a refugee and those who qualify under the refugee convention and are fleeing persecution. Famine victims do not qualify

It is commonplace to speak of those in flight from famine , or otherwise migrating in search of food, as “refugees.” Over the past decade alone, millions of persons have abandoned their homes in countries such as North Korea, Sudan, Ethiopia, Congo, and Somalia, hoping that by moving they could find the nourishment needed to survive. In a colloquial sense, these people are refugees: they are on the move not by choice, but rather because their own desperation compels them to pursue a survival strategy away from the desperation confronting their home communities. In legal terms, however, refugee status is defined in a significantly more constrained way. The key standard, set by the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951,1 as supplemented by the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 1967,2 limits refugee status to a person who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. . .

 People who are just seeking to improve their lives are not refugees
Joseph Carens, 2013, Joseph H. Carens is a professor at the Department of Political Science of the University of Toronto, Canada. His research interests are mainly focused on contemporary political theory, especially on issues related to immigration and political community, The Ethics of Immigration, Kindle Edition, page number at end of card.
People seeking asylum in democratic states often meet a skeptical and critical inquiry into the question of whether they are really refugees. Every democratic state has established a set of laws and institutions to determine whether particular asylum claimants meet the requirements of the Convention. The use of the term “persecution” is clearly intended in part to recognize the principle that we should not lightly override the normal rule that states are free to exercise discretionary control over entry and settlement by noncitizens. Given the premises of this chapter, that is a reasonable concern. No state is perfect. The ordinary failures of law enforcement, like the ordinary inequalities of the modern world, do not provide grounds for giving someone refugee status. 19 To deserve refugee status a person must be facing a serious threat to her fundamental interests, not simply the risks faced in ordinary life in a society that normally protects people’s basic human rights.

Although central to the refugee definition, ‘persecution’ itself is not defined in the 1951 Convention. Articles 31 and 33 refer to threats to life or freedom, so clearly it includes the threat of death, or the threat of torture, or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. A comprehensive analysis requires the general notion to be related to developments within the broad field of human rights,6 and the recognition that fear of persecution and lack of protection are themselves interrelated elements. The persecuted do not enjoy the protection of their country of origin, while evidence of the lack of protection on either the internal or external level may create a presumption as to the (p. 39) likelihood of persecution and to the well-foundedness of any fear. However, there is no necessary linkage between persecution and government authority. A Convention refugee, by definition, must be unable or unwilling to avail him- or herself of the protection of the state or government, and the notion of inability to secure the protection of the state is broad enough to include a situation where the authorities cannot or will not provide protection, for example, against persecution by non-state actors. The Convention does require that the persecution feared be for reasons of ‘race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion’. This language, which recalls the language of non-discrimination in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent human rights instruments, gives an insight into the characteristics of individuals and groups which are considered relevant to refugee protection. These reasons in turn show that the groups or individuals are identified by reference to a classification which ought to be irrelevant to the enjoyment of fundamental human rights, while persecution implies a violation of human rights of particular gravity; it may be the result of cumulative events or systemic mistreatment, but equally it could comprise a single act of torture (Hathaway 2005; Goodwin-Gill and McAdam 2007).

 Current Events / Status Quo New Global Refugee Pact, but the US and Hungry oppose it
UN News, December 17, 2018, https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/12/1028791 UN affirms ‘historic’ global compact to support world’s refugees
The United Nations General Assembly affirmed a non-legally binding Global Compact on Refugees on Monday, marking the latest move by Member States to support the rights of over 68.5 million people have been forced to flee worldwide, including more than 25.4 million people who have crossed borders to become refugees. An overwhelming number of majority States, 181, voted in favor of adopting the compact, with the United States and Hungary opposing the move. The Dominican Republic, Eritrea and Libya abstained. UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) Chief, Filippo Grandi, said the pact was “historic” and speaking at an event at UN Headquarters in New York to mark the compact, noted it was the first time the Assembly has seen an agreement between and beyond States, that acknowledges the need to work collectively for the rights of refugees. “In this world of ours, which often turns it back to people in need, that has shamefully politicized even the pain of exile, that has demonized and continues to demonize refugees and migrants and sometimes even just foreigners, this compact, in synergy with the other compact, the compact on migration, can really represent tangibly, a new commitment to international cooperation,” said the UNHCR chief. He said it represented “a new commitment to shared values of solidarity and the quest to just and sustainable solutions for disadvantaged people.” This global compact for refugees, which is separate from the newly-adopted Global Compact for Migration, aims to strengthen the international response to large movements of refugees and their protracted situations, and was prompted by the historic, 2016 New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, in which all 193 Member States agreed that the protection of refugees should be a shared responsibility. The Declaration tasked UNHCR with authoring the refugee compact, which came to fruition after 18 months of extensive consultations between Member States, experts, civil society, and refugees. Just last week, the Global Compact for Migration, also non-legally binding, was adopted by 164 Governments at an international conference in Marrakech, Morocco in a bid to support safe, orderly and regular migration. This “great achievement for multilateralism,” as UN senior migration official, Ms. Lousie Arbour called it, specifically targets the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, which comprise a different group of people on the move than refugees. More on that and the crucial differences, can be found here. Approximately 85 percent of refugees live in developing countries, according to UNHCR, where services are already strained. Though donors have been generous in financing aid to refugees, Mr. Grandi noted that the disproportionate burden on middle and low-income countries is evident, and leaves us “at the mercy of economic downturns.” Thus, part of the compact’s pledge to joint action entails addressing the specific challenges faced by developing host countries. In recent years we have seen a contagion of closed borders, contrary to national refugee and human rights law - Deputy UN chief Amina Mohammed In addition, Mr. Grandi urged States to re-evaluate the way refugees are supported to be more inclusive: “The image that we have of refugees is the refugee camp. We want to get away from that.”
Poor countries take most of the refugees now
Tina Rosenberg, August 21, 2018, New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/refugee-camps- integration.html A New Deal for Refugees
There's a reason refugee camps exist: Host governments like them. Liberating refugees is a hard sell. In camps, refugees
38
              are the United Nations' problem. Out of camps, refugees are the local governments' problem. Last year, the United

 States accepted about 30,000 refugees. Uganda, which is a global model for how it treats refugees, has one-seventh of America's population and a tiny fraction of the wealth. Yet, it took in 1,800 refugees per day between mid-2016 and mid-2017 from South Sudan alone. And that's one of four neighbours whose people take refuge in Uganda. Bangladesh, already the world's most crowded major nation, has accepted more than a million Rohingya fleeing ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. "If we can feed 160 million people, then (feeding) another 500,000-700,000 ... We can do it. We can share our food," Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's Prime Minister, said last year. Lebanon is host to approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees, in addition to a half-million Palestinians, some of whom have been there for generations. One in three residents of Lebanon is a refugee. Over the last 50 years, only one developing country has granted refugees full rights. In Uganda, refugees can live normally. Instead of camps there are settlements, where refugees stay voluntarily. The refugee burden falls heavily on a few, poor countries, some of them at risk of destabilisation, which can in turn produce more refugees. The rest of the world has been unwilling to share that burden. But something happened that could lead to real change: Beginning in 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossed the Mediterranean in small boats and life rafts into Europe. Suddenly, wealthy European countries got interested in fixing a broken system: Making it more financially viable, more dignified for refugees and more palatable for host governments and communities.
Current funding for refugees very low
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, October 9, 2018 , Refugees Bear Cost Of Massive Underfunding, http://shalomfafrica.com/?q=content/refugees-bear-cost-massive-underfunding
This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Babar Baloch to whom quoted text may be attributed at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. Funding for the world's forcibly displaced and stateless people is becoming increasingly squeezed, with barely more than half of needs being met, and worsening hardship and risks for many refugees, other displaced people and the communities they live among. This is according to a new report released today by the Donor Relations and Resource Mobilization Service of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. With 68.5 million people forcibly displaced worldwide as of the start of this year, funding by governments for refugee and other displacement situations has seldom been more pressured. Based on contributions to date we expect funding for 2018 to meet just 55 per cent of the $8.2 billion that is needed. This compares to 56.6 per cent in 2017 and 58 per cent in 2016. In short, donor funding is falling increasingly behind as the number of forcibly displaced worldwide has grown. And the consequences for refugees and internally displaced people in particular are becoming all too real. In situation after situation we are seeing increases in malnutrition, health facilities being overcrowded, housing and shelters becoming increasingly dilapidated, children either in overcrowded classrooms or doing without school altogether, and growing protection risks because of shortages of personnel to deal with unaccompanied children or victims or sexual violence. Six refugee and displacement situations globally are particularly badly hit. These include Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Syria and Somalia situations. UNHCR expresses particular thanks to donors of flexible funding whose critical support has been essential to mitigating the impact by allowing us to direct funds where they are most needed.

 The National Interest
To start, many Pro teams will want to clearly define the national interest as being what is in the self-interest of the nation in terms of protecting its own power. This is the Realist definition of the national interest.
There are several reasons the national interest should be prioritized.
First, Governments must concern themselves with their own survival because their decisions impact many people and impact future generations
Hans Morgenthau, political scientist, 1950, The American Political Science Review, The Mainsprings of American Foreign Policy: The National Interest v. Moral Abstractions, p. 853
Indeed, the rule of morality in this respect is not precisely the same between nations as between individuals. The duty of making its own welfare the guide of its actions, is much stronger upon the former than upon the latter; in proportion to the greater magnitude and importance of national compared with individual happiness, and to the greater permanency of the effects of national than of individual conduct. Existing millions, and for the most part future generations, are concerned in the present measures of a government; while the consequences of the private actions of an individual ordinarily terminate with himself or are circumscribed within a narrow compass.
Second, since no international body can protect individual nations, individual nations must protect themselves.
Hans Morgenthau, political scientist, 1950, The American Political Science Review, The Mainsprings of American Foreign Policy: The National Interest v. Moral Abstractions, p. 854-5
The fundamental error which has thwarted American foreign- policy in thought and action is the antithesis of national interest and moral principles. The equation of political moralism with morality and of political realism with immorality is itself untenable. The choice is not between moral principles and the national interest, devoid of moral dignity, but between one set of moral principles, divorced from political reality, and another set of moral principles, derived from political reality. The basic fact of international politics is the absence of a society able to protect the existence, and to promote the interests, of the individual nations. For the individual nations to take care of their own national interests is, then, a political necessity. There can be no moral duty to neglect them; for as the international society is at present constituted, the consistent neglect of the national interest can only lead to national suicide. Yet it can be shown that there exists even a positive moral duty for the individual nation to take care of its national interests. In the absence of an integrated international society, in particular, the attainment of a modicum of order and the realization of a minimum of moral values are predicated upon the existence of national communities capable of preserving order and realizing moral values within the limits of their power. It is obvious that such a state of affairs falls far short of that order and realized morality to which we are accustomed in national societies. The only relevant question is, however, what the practical alternative is to these imperfections of an international society based upon the national interests of its component parts. The attainable alternative is not a higher morality realized through the application of universal moral principles, but moral deterioration through either political failure or the fanaticism of political crusades. The juxtaposition of the morality of political moralism and the immorality of the national interest is mistaken. It operates with a false concept of morality, developed by national societies but unsuited to the conditions of international society. In the process of its realization, it is bound to destroy the very moral values which it is its purpose to promote. Hence, the antithesis between moral principles and the national interest is not
41
  
 only intellectually mistaken but also morally pernicious. A foreign policy derived from the national interest is in fact morally superior to a foreign policy inspired by universal moral principles.
Failure to protect the national interests of the state will result in its destruction.
Kenneth Waltz, Political Scientist, 1984 (NEOLIBERALISM AND ITS CRITICS, ed. Keohane, pp. 117-8)
A self-help system is one in which those who do not help themselves, or who do so less effectively than others, will suffer. Fear of such unwanted consequences stimulates states to behave in ways that tend toward the creation of balances of power. Notice that the theory requires no assumptions of rationality or of constancy of will on the part of all the actors. The theory says simply that if some do relatively well, others will emulate them or fall by the wayside. Obviously, the system won’t work if all states lose interest in preserving themselves. It will, however, continue to work if some states do, while others do not, choose to lose their political identities, say, through amalgamation. Nor need it be assured that all the competing states are striving relentlessly to increase their power. The possibility that force may be used by some states to weaken or destroy others does, however, make it difficult for them to break out of the competitive system.
Pro teams could mount an even greater defense of acting in the national interest, but this is a good start.

 Sovereignty
As sovereign nations, states have the right to control their own borders.

The movement of people between states, whether refugees or ‘migrants’, takes place in a context in which sovereignty remains important, and specifically that aspect of sovereign competence which entitles the state to exercise prima facie exclusive jurisdiction over its territory, and to decide who among non-citizens shall be allowed to enter and remain, and who shall be refused admission and required or compelled to leave. Like every sovereign power, this competence must be exercised within and according to law, and the state’s right to control the admission of non-citizens is subject to certain well-defined exceptions in favour of those in search of refuge, among others. Moreover, the state which seeks to exercise migration controls outside its territory, for example, through the physical interception, ‘interdiction’, and return of asylum seekers and forced migrants, may also be liable for actions which breach those of its international obligations which apply extra-territorially (Goodwin-Gill 2011; Moreno Lax 2011, 2012).1
Maintaining a strong system of sovereign states is important to maintaining the global order
Mohammed Ayoob, James Madison, Michigan State, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FO HUMAN RIGHTS, Spring 2002, p. 81
The concept of international society privileges the states as the sole repository of sovereign authority and is based on the assumption that international order can be best maintained if states respect each other’s sovereignty by adhering to the norms of non-intervention in the external affairs of other states. This has been the fundamental premise on including international law, diplomacy, and international organizations, have been traditionally established. Respect for state sovereignty, therefore, forms the cornerstone of what Robert Jackson has termed the “global covenant” which, in turn, acts as the foundation for international order. Respect for this covenant is all the more important in the contemporary context where membership of the international system has expanded exponentially and the notion of common (European) culture undergirding international order has been dramatically eroded.

 Social Contract/Right to Associate
Social contractarian theorists hold that individuals form societies by creating figurative contracts between members of a given society. These contracts create certain opportunities and obligations for members of the given society, but those obligations do not extend beyond the members of that society. Since refugees exist outside that society, our obligations are not bound by any ethical or political contract.
Philosopher Christopher Wellman takes this a step farther, arguing that we have the freedom to associate with who we want and therefore have no obligations to refugees.
Christopher Heath Wellman, professor of philosophy, University of St. Louis, 2008, Immigration and the Freedom of Association, Published in Ethics, October, http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/phil267fa12/Immigration%20Proofs.pdf DOA: 9-30-15
In this article I appeal to freedom of association to defend a state’s right to control immigration over its territorial borders. Without denying that those of us in wealthy societies may have extremely demanding duties of global distributive justice, I ultimately reach the stark conclusion that every legitimate state has the right to close its doors to all potential immigrants, even refugees desperately seeking asylum from incompetent or corrupt political regimes that are either unable or unwilling to protect their citizens’ basic moral rights.
States, via sovereign right and supported by social contract theory, have the absolute right to control membership in their own state
Christopher Heath Wellman, professor of philosophy, University of St. Louis, 2008, Immigration and the Freedom of Association, Published in Ethics, October, http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/phil267fa12/Immigration%20Proofs.pdf DOA: 9-30-15
What is more, for several reasons it seems clear that control over membership in one’s state is extremely important. To see this, think about why people might care about the membership rules for their golf club. It is tempting to think that club members would be irrational to care about who else are (or could become) members; after all, they are not forced to actually play golf with those members they dislike. But this perspective misses something important. Members of golf clubs typically care about the membership rules because they care about how the club is organized and the new members have a say in how the club is organized. Some members might want to dramatically increase the number of members, for instance, because the increased numbers will mean that each individual is required to pay less. Other members might oppose expanding the membership because of concerns about the difficulty of securing desirable tee times, the wear and tear on the course, and the increased time it takes to play a round if there are more people on the course at any given time.
And if there is nothing mysterious about people caring about who are (or could become) members of their golf clubs, there is certainly nothing irrational about people being heavily invested in their country’s immigration policy. Again, to note the lack of intimacy among com- patriots is to miss an important part of the story. It is no good to tell citizens that they need not personally (let alone intimately) associate with any fellow citizens they happen to dislike because fellow citizens nonetheless remain political associates; the country’s course will be c harted by the members of this civic association. The point is that people rightly care very deeply about their countries, and, as a consequence, they rightly care about those policies which will effect how these political communities evolve. And since a country’s immigration policy affects who will share in controlling the country’s future, it is a matter of considerable importance.
The right to exclude immigrants is deontological, turning any pro morality claims.

Before turning to the case against political freedom of association, I would like to highlight two features of the view I am advancing here: (1) I defend a deontological right to limit immigration rather than a consequential account of what would be best, and (2) my view might be dubbed “universalist” rather than “particularist” insofar as it neither suggests nor implies that only distinct nations, cultures, or other “communities of character” are entitled to limit immigration. Consider each of these points in turn.
First, let me stress that I seek to defend a deontological conclusion about how legitimate states are entitled to act, not a consequential prescription for how to maximize happiness or a practical recipe for how states might best promote their own interests. I understand that groups can have weighty reasons to limit immigration in certain circumstances, but what the best policy would be for any given state’s constituents (and/ or for those foreigners affected) will presumably depend upon a variety of empirical matters, matters about which others are more knowledge- able. Thus, I doubt that any one-size-fits-all immigration policy exists, and I, qua philosopher, have no special qualification to comment on the empirical information that would be relevant to fashioning the best policy for any given state. However, if anything, I am personally inclined toward more open borders. My parents were born and raised in different countries, so I would not even be here to write this article if people were not free to cross political borders. What is more, my family and I have profited enormously from having lived and worked in several dif- ferent countries, so it should come as no surprise that I believe that, just as few individuals flourish in personal isolation, open borders are typically (and within limits) best for political communities and their constituents. Still, just as one might defend the right to divorce without believing that many couples should in fact separate, I defend a legitimate state’s right to control its borders without suggesting that strict limits on immigration would necessarily maximize the interests of either the state’s constituents or humanity as a whole. My aim is merely to show that whatever deontological reasons there are to respect freedom of association count in favor of allowing political communities to set their own immigration policy.

 Terrorism

 Terrorism Overview
One concrete reason why a country needs to prioritize the protection of their borders is that accepting more refugees increases the risk that terrorists will enter the country.
Widespread acceptance of refugees in many countries in Europe places the continent at-risk of terrorism.
Fox News, July 27, 2016 Europe terror attacks spotlight security failings amid refugee crisis, http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/27/europe-terror-attacks-spotlight-security-failings-amid- refugee-crisis.html DOA: 8-8-16
The European policy Germans call “Willkommenskultur” -- the enthusiastic embrace of refugees from Syria and other Muslim-majority countries -- has morphed into a summer of terror. Loose screening of refugees, lax counter-terrorism policies and lenient treatment of those with terrorist links or sympathies has led to a spate of attacks by terrorists already flagged by authorities. Tuesday’s attack in France, where a jihadist already under house arrest slit a priest’s throat, came just two days after a suicide bombing in Germany by a terrorist who a medical expert had predicted would “commit suicide in a spectacular fashion.” Critics say such cases are piling up. "It has happened in France and the UK -- people who were on the radar and eventually were caught up in plots,” said Davis Lewin, deputy director at the Henry Jackson Society, a UK based counter-terrorism think tank. “It will inevitably happen again.” Sunday’s suicide bombing in the southern city of Ansbach was the first attributed to ISIS to take place in Germany. Mohammed Daleel injured 15 people when he detonated a bomb outside a concert, killing himself. The attack has Germans asking why a Syrian refugee known as highly dangerous to the authorities as early as 2015 was still in the country. Daleel “can be trusted that he will commit suicide in a spectacular fashion,” a medical report stated. His digital trail showed “constant contact with a soldier of the Islamic State,” according to German investigators. It is unclear why the authorities did not arrest him, but they did move to deport him earlier this year. The effort was blocked by German Left Party MP Harald Weinberg, who demanded that Daleel get medical care for a knee injury. “After everything I knew at that time, I would decide the same today,” Weinberg told the newspaper BILD. One of the self-described “soldiers of ISIS" in Tuesday’s attack in the Normandy region of France, Adel Kermiche, had been arrested in 2015 after twice trying to enter Syria through Turkey to join ISIS. Upon his return to France, he was placed under police supervision and wore an electronic tag to monitor his movements. The device was turned off for four hours each day, and it was in that window that he and Abdel Malik killed an 85-year-old priest during Mass. “What was France thinking about when they turned off his electronic bracelet for a couple of hours a day?” Lewin said. But, he added, “the threat is severe and the intelligence services do not have the resources to follow up everyone. And they have to make decisions who to follow.” Europe must invest heavily in security services, implement much stricter controls on immigration and clamp down on radical ideology, he said. “It is much too easy to propagate radical Islamic views,” Lewin said. “Politicians need to clamp down on the ideology.” France has been the target of the most devastating ISIS attacks, including the Nov. 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris and the July 14 attack in Nice. More than 200 people died in the two attacks. Germany is reeling from a fresh wave of terrorism this month, including the Ansbach attack and another July 18, in which Mohammed Riyad took an ax to passengers on a Bavarian train, yelling “Alahu Akbar” as he injured five. Riyad claimed to be from Afghanistan, but authorities now believe he may be from Pakistan, and lied to have a better chance at asylum. There are currently 59 ongoing investigations of refugees because of the “suspicion that they are involved in terrorist structures,” according to Germany’s interior ministry.

The State Department is hoping to bring an average of nearly 1,500 Syrian refugees to the United States per month in order to meet President Obama's target of settling 10,000 refugees in the country by September. About 1,300 refugees have already been placed in the United States since Obama first made the commitment in September. That's far fewer than those taken in by European countries such as Germany, who has dealt with an unprecedented wave of migrants fleeing Syria's civil war, as well as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Yet the settlement has provoked a significant backlash, mostly from Republicans, who argue it puts the U.S. at risk from terrorism. “It's clear that ISIS wants to, has planned on attempting to infiltrate refugee populations. This is a problem. If one person gets through who is planning a terrorist attack in our country, that's a problem,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, who recently returned from a trip to the region, said Thursday. “The administration — whether it's Homeland Security or the FBI, cannot tell us that they can adequately screen people. There isn't really a Syria to talk to on that end of the equation to vet people, so it is a problem,” Ryan told reporters. The State Department says it has fallen behind schedule in meting Obama’s goal partly due to a lack of personnel available to interview refugees. It is now doing a “surge operation” in Amman, Jordan, that is designed to process the rest of the Syrian refugees in as little as three months and leave them enough time to get to the U.S. before September. The State Department has devoted more staff in Amman to focus on processing Syrian refugees, as well as hired new employees, which the department says it needed anyway. “By putting more officers in one place we can conduct more interviews. Partly we have a backlog because we don’t have enough officers to interview people,” Larry Bartlett, the State Department's director of the Office of Refugee Admissions, told The Hill in a recent interview. “So part of it is a little bit of shifting. We’ve also done some new hiring, and it was hiring that was timely. Those were people we needed anyway but they came onboard in time for this surge operation,” said Bartlett. He did not say how many staff were added in Amman. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has prioritized sending more refugees to the U.S. than other countries, he said So far, about 9,500 Syrians have been interviewed in Amman since February 1, and 12,000 interviews should be completed by April 28, according to a State Department spokesperson. Republican critics argue that speeding up the process to as little as three months will make it easier for terrorists to slip through.
Vetting procedures are not likely to be effective at reducing terrorism.

Of course, maybe that doesn’t make a difference since the vetting was a hoax anyway. Our security agencies have already noted that it is impossible to vet people from a failed state. It is, however, possible to go to the Department of State website and be reassured that our vetting processes are as rigorous as they are extensive. Just
                     48
   
 ask the victims of the San Bernardino massacre how extensive our vetting processes are. San Bernardino butcher Tashfeen Malik was given a visa in just weeks despite giving a non-existent address in Pakistan. The approval was just plain sloppy on a number of issues. If you live in one of the 82 preferred communities, the normal, expected number for absorption is a floor of 100. Since Obama’s focus on an additional 10,000, preferred communities have been asked to absorb additional refugees. My local refugee contractor denies that, which leads me to believe that nothing about refugee resettlement is to be believed until it is denied. Obama started with 10,000, but John Kerry went to Congress and spoke of our taking 30,000 refugees. And then there is the omnibus agreement, as Breitbart notes, that funds 300,000 visas to migrants from Muslim countries in the next year alone. As anyone remotely acquainted with immigration policy knows, visa allocations are generally interchangeable across categories. Besides, overstaying a legitimate visa is a common way to stay in this country as an illegal immigrant. In Paris, one of the jihadists shot dead at the concert venue was in possession of a fake Syrian passport, prompting a debate whether refugees or more commonly Muslims born in Europe were more likely to be responsible for acts of violence on European soil. So far, the numbers seem to stack up in favor of those born in Europe. This seems to suggest that we have only to await the maturation of the children of refugees before we experience the violence visited upon Europe.

Resettling refugees massively increases the risk of high-profile terrorist attacks – Paris attacks prove
Simcox 18 (Robin Simcox, pecializes in terrorism and national security analysis as the Margaret Thatcher Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, June 18, 2018, "The Asylum–Terror Nexus: How Europe Should Respond," Heritage Foundation, https://www.heritage.org/terrorism/report/the-asylum-terror-nexus-how-europe-should-respond
In November 2015, an ISIS cell killed 130 and injured 368 in coordinated attacks across Paris. In order to plan the atrocity, key members of the cell—a mix of those born in Europe and those born in the Middle East, South Asia, or North Africa—used migrant routes to travel back and forth between Syria and Europe. The potential security risk that bogus asylum seekers pose in Europe was brought into focus with more urgency than
ever. It proved disturbingly simple for these ISIS members to conceal themselves among genuine refugees as, at the time, European borders were under great strain. In Africa, hundreds of thousands of people had used an increasingly lawless Libya as a gateway from which to land in Italy via the Mediterranean Sea. In the Middle East, the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria saw hundreds of thousands head to Europe via Turkey. Massive burdens were placed on Greek landing ports and neighboring Balkan countries as asylum seekers headed north. In the fall of 2015, Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany’s
borders in an attempt to respond to the crisis. The morality and long-term wisdom of this decision remain fiercely debated. Yet the short-term impact on European security is more clear-cut. Pew polling from September 2016 had demonstrated that 59 percent in Europe believed that the refugee crisis would lead to more terrorist attacks.1 The public’s instinct was proven correct, as asylum seekers struck in ISIS’s name in Berlin, Stockholm, London, and other Western European cities. European leaders must recognize mistakes of the past and control the flow of refugees strictly in the future. As most terrorism plots involving refugees and asylum seekers are prevented or occur within
three years of arrival, European security agencies should prioritize monitoring very recent arrivals whom they assess to present a risk. The security agencies should also show a willingness to review how intelligence can be shared more widely with local police. Context The recent refugee and migrant flow has forced policymakers to consider security issues related to accepting large amounts of asylum seekers from conflict zones. Yet the negative security implications stemming from European states being insufficiently prudent about accepting Islamist asylum seekers is a decades-old phenomenon. In the 1990s, Islamist ideologues fled authoritarian states across the Middle East and North Africa, claiming asylum in Europe. The likes of Jordanian-Palestinian Abu Qatada al-Filistini; Egyptians, such as Hani al-Sibai and Anwar Shabaan; and Syrian Omar Bakri Mohammed all subsequently helped mainstream Islamist causes in segments of European Muslim communities. The consequences live on: Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena suicide bomber of May 2017, was the son of a Libyan Islamic Fighting Group refugee
who arrived in the U.K. in the 1990s.2 Most asylum seekers heading to Europe do not pose a terrorist threat. Furthermore, most plots in Europe do not involve refugees or asylum seekers. There were 194 publicly disclosed Islamist terror plots or acts of violence between January 2014 and December 2017; only 16 percent involve refugees or asylum seekers.3 European police forces have also received almost 2,000 tip-offs from refugees themselves about terrorist
activity.4 One high-profile example led to the arrest of an ISIS operative in Leipzig, Germany.5 None of this makes Western European countries’ handling of
migration flows any less catastrophic. Nor does it alter the fact that the terrorist threat in Europe has increased as a direct result
of immigration and open-border policies. Data This Backgrounder analyzes terrorist attacks planned in the period between January 2014 and
December 2017. During this time, there were a minimum of 32 plots featuring refugees or asylum seekers that were either foiled or took place (an average of eight a year), which featured a total of 44 refugees or asylum seekers.6 The overall number of European plots involving refugees or asylum seekers was
relatively small in 2014 and 2015. However, one of those plots was the most devastating terrorist attack in Europe since the al-Qaeda-
linked bombings of Madrid in March 2004: ISIS’s attacks in Paris in November 2015. A series of cases in Germany tied to recent arrivals from Syria drove a sharp increase in plots in 2016, before a drop in 2017. Overall, 84 percent of cases connected to asylum seekers or refugees occurred in the last two years of this four- year study.
Large increases in refugee intake massively increase the risk of terrorism
Deacon 17 (Liam Deacon, 3 Aug 2017, "Report: Half of Terror Plots in Germany by ‘Refugees’," Breitbart,
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/08/03/report-half-terror-plots-germany-refugees-targeted-migrant-crisis/
More than half (54 per cent) of terror plots in Germany have involved asylum seekers and refugees since 2014 and the onset of the migrant crisis. The report, by the Heritage Foundation think tank, found that attacks across Europe by foreign trained militants increased dramatically in 2016, following the height of the migrant influx, with Germany becoming a much more popular target. “The increase in the threat to Germany is especially stark,” the report’s authors write. “There were no plots in Germany in 2014, and only two in 2015. In 2016, this increased eightfold. “There is a straightforward reason for this: In 2015, Germany took in over 1 million refugees and 2016 saw a surge in plots involving refugees.” Plots in Germany comprised just 5 per cent of those in Europe in50
                                           
 2015, shooting up to 27 per cent in 2016. In fact, the nation faced more plots in 2016 alone than in the decade and a half between 2000 and 2015, with civilian rather than government targets most common. In total, 142 Islamism plots claimed 300 lives and more than 1,000 casualties, in 15 European nations, over the 29-month period studied by the think tank. Across the continent, around 15 per cent of the plots (142) featured refugees and asylum seekers, implicated in either planning the attacks alone or as part of a larger cell. The migrant planned attacks struck nine separate European countries, but mainly targeted Germany (12 of the 22 plots). In 2014 and 2015, there were just three plots by foreign trained attackers in Europe, all linked to Iraq, with the most prominent example being the Paris attacks. In 2016, however, the continent was struck by 16 such plots by migrants and foreign fighters, 11 targeting Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel suspended the Dublin regulations and effectively opened the nation’s borders in 2015. Since then, Germany has taken far more migrants than any other European nation. Before 2016 – the year after around a million asylum seekers poured into the nation – Germany was not targeted by those trained abroad, with France and the UK facing the most attacks of this nature, the report explains. Yet, during 2016, 60 per cent of all plots in Germany were conducted or planned by foreign trained militants, all of whom had fought or trained in Syria. In 15 of the 22 (68 per cent) plots hatched in Germany since 2014, one of the cell’s perpetrators was in direct contact with a foreign terror group. This is disproportionately high when compared to rest of the continent, in which only 64 of the 142 plots (45 per cent) had one or more members known to have been in
contact with such groups. “The main source of this threat is from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), which has taken advantage of the refugee crisis in order to smuggle its operatives into Europe,” the report’s authors explained.
Data proves refugee influxes massively increase the risk of terrorism

European Islamist Plots and Attacks Since 2014—and How the U.S. Can Help Prevent Them, https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2017-08/BG3236.pdf
Twenty-two of the 142 plots (15 percent) featured refugees and asylum seekers, either planning attacks alone or as part of a larger cell.14 Refugees and asylum seekers linked to these plots came to Europe from a range of countries: Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq, Morocco, Somalia, Syria, Tunisia, Russia’s Southern Caucasus, and Uzbekistan. There were also refugees from Algeria, although they entered Europe posing as Syrians. Refugees or asylum seekers have planned attacks in nine countries: Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. Yet overall, the threat to Europe from refugees and asylum seekers plotting has been concentrated in Germany—12 of the 22 plots (54 percent), with an additional case in which a suspected attack planned for Copenhagen was being organized from Baden Württemberg in Germany.15 In 15 of the 22 German plots (68 percent), one of the cell’s perpetrators was in direct contact with a foreign terrorist organization. This is disproportionately high: In total, only 64 of the 142 plots (45 percent) had one or more members known to have been in contact with a
FTO. Plots involving refugees or asylum seekers most commonly targeted civilians (59 percent) and, where known, explosives were the
most popular weapon of choice (32 percent). Year-by-Year Breakdown. In terms of the volume of these kinds of plots, the threat was relatively
minor until 2016, the year after Germany allowed over 1 million asylum seekers and refugees into the country. There were only three plots featuring refugees or asylum seekers between 2014 and 2015 (although one of these was the devastating attack in Paris in November 2015). All were tied to Iraq.
In 2016 alone, however, there were 16 plots. Eleven of these plots targeted Germany. The year 2016 also reflected a broad range of countries of origin for these asylum seekers and refugees: Syria (on nine occasions); Tunisia (twice); Algeria (although they had entered Germany with fake Syrian passports); and
Afghanistan, Eritrea, Morocco, and Somalia (each on one occasion). With one exception, all the Syrian refugee cells were known to be in contact with ISIS

 Germany Proves Terrorism Refugees causes terrorism – Germany proves
Johnson 18 (Natalie Johnson, staff writer at the Washington Free Beacon, June 19, 2018 Almost 1,000 People Injured, Killed in Terrorist Attacks By Refugees," Washington Free Beacon, http://freebeacon.com/national-security/almost-1000- people-injured-killed-terrorist-attacks-refugees/
Nearly 1,000 people were injured or killed in terrorist attacks involving refugees over a four-year span, with Germany facing the highest number of terror plots, according to a new Heritage Foundation report published Monday. Data collected from the 194 terrorist plots detected across Europe between January 2014 and December 2017 point to a more than one-in-three chance that Germany will be the country targeted in future terror schemes, with civilians being the primary bullseye. Though only 32, or 16 percent, of those
terrorist plots involved refugees or asylum seekers, 41 percent of all plots occurred in Germany. France was the second most targeted country, with Belgium and the United Kingdom trailing closely behind. The report comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces the threat of her government collapsing over its open-door policy toward migrants, which critics say has left the country more vulnerable to terrorism. Germany is still struggling to absorb the 1.4 million asylum
seekers who arrived three years ago primarily from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. "It's not as if the Islamist terrorism threat appeared with the Germany refugee flow, of course there were plots there in the past, but the scale has transformed entirely since [Merkel's] decision to open the borders," said Robin Simcox, a terrorism and national security analyst at the Heritage Foundation who authored the study. "The amount of plots that Germany faced after the 2015 refugee flow just increased exponentially, and when you look at the perpetrators behind those plots it's more often than not they're recent arrivals into the country and
there's very often a Syria component to it." The report found that of the 15 Syrian jihadists who plotted attacks over the past four years, 12 were involved in operations targeting Germany. Simcox said Europe must take immediate steps to more quickly deport migrants who have been denied asylum, particularly given that nearly three-quarters of attackers were asylum seekers who either either committed an attack or had it thwarted within two years of arrival.

 Vetting doesn’t solve
Vetting doesn’t solve – refugees don’t assimilate when they arrive which causes radicalization later
*Also says 61 examples
CBN 17 (CBN News, 7-5-2017, "New Report: Refugee Terrorism Problem is Bigger Than You Think," http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2017/july/new-report-refugee-terrorism-problem-is-bigger-than-you-think
A new report reveals that at least 61 people who came to the United States as refugees between 2002 and 2016 participated in
terror activities aimed at injuring or slaughtering people on U.S. soil. This new information from the Heritage Foundation could provide new fuel to the debate
over immigration policy and President Trump's recently reinstated travel ban. The Heritage Foundation identified dozens of refugees who came to the United
States and did anything from lying to authorities about ongoing terror plots, to personally taking part in terror plots
themselves. The report also presents a new problem -- that none of the United State's security efforts can effectively prevent the "1.5 generation," or individuals who immigrate to the country before or during their early teens, from becoming radicalized after they have already entered the country. What's unique about the 1.5
generation is these young refugees do not let go of the cultural values and characteristics of their home country when they reach the United States. Therefore, assimilation becomes much harder and radicalization becomes much easier. Olivia Enos, who helped conduct the
study, says the 1.5 generation is "arguably the greatest threat to the U.S." "Those who tend to be involved in aiding and abetting in terrorism do come from this 1.5 generation," She told CBN News. John Cooper, a spokesman for the Heritage Foundation, says one solution to this problem is to make meaningful
changes in America's assimilation process for new refugees and immigrants. "Given the threat that we found in the 1.5 generation, more needs to be done in the U.S. assimilation process," Cooper told Fox News. "We can't vet an 8-year-old to see if he will become a terrorist when he turns 18 or 28. Instead, we as a country need to rethink the way we assimilate refugees, and immigrants as a whole for that matter.
Resettlement leads to terror attacks – vetting doesn’t solve
McKay 17 (Hollie Mckay, 7-5-2017, "Terror-related acts committed by refugees widespread, according to new report," Fox News, http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/05/terror-related-acts-committed-by-refugees-widespread- according-to-new-report.html
At least 61 people who came to the United States as refugees engaged in terrorist activities between 2002 and 2016, according to an explosive new report coming on the heels of the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of much of President Trump’s travel ban. The alarming report by the Heritage Foundation identified scores of refugees, including many who came prior to 2002, as having taken part in activities ranging from lying to investigators about terror plots, to actually taking part in them. The report, aimed at reforming the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, or USRAP, calls for stricter
limits and restrictions on refugees. “There is no universal right to migrate, resettlement is not the solution to mass displacement, and U.S. policymakers have a responsibility to ensure that the United States takes in only as many refugees as it can safely vet and assimilate,” the report states. “The United States operates the program not because it is obligated to resettle refugees, but because the U.S. is a humane country and USRAP serves its national interests.” The report, written by policy analyst David Inserra, could lend weight to the Trump administration's effort to curtail the number of refugees who come to the U.S. every
year. But perhaps most worrisome, the report warns that no amount of refugee vetting can account for the "1.5 generation" -- those who come to the U.S. with peaceful intentions and then become radicalized while living in America. “Given the threat that we found in the 1.5 generation, more needs to be done in the U.S. assimilation process,” said John Cooper, spokesman for the Heritage Foundation. “We can’t vet an 8-year-old to see if he will become a terrorist when he turns 18 or 28. Instead, we as a country need to rethink the way we assimilate refugees, and immigrants as a whole for that matter. “In the past few decades, the United States has drifted from its strong assimilation ethos, and the terrorism in Europe paints a disturbing picture of where non-assimilation leads,” he added.

 Terrorism Impacts The risk of bioterror is high and risks extinction
Pedersen, 17—Pepperdine University (Christian, “Reflecting Back on the Ebola Outbreak and the Future of Bioterrorism,” Pepperdine Policy Review: Vol. 9)
Terror groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) have expressed interested, and have even attempted, to use biological agents in terror plots (Biodefense, 2016). The technical and administrative knowledge of biology and chemistry can be acquired globally in medical schools, research programs, and laboratories, making it difficult to prevent potential practitioners of bioterrorism from acquiring the required scientific knowledge (Chiodo, 2015). While at one time the ability to mutate strands was restricted to advanced research laboratories, rudimentary high school laboratories now have the ability to develop deadly biological agents (Garrett, 2012). With relative easy, terror groups could engineer the flu virus, making it deadlier (Selk, 2017). By combining traits of multiple strains and maximizing the virus’ natural properties, it could become highly transmittable (Farmer, 2107). Genetically engineered viruses have the potential to kill more people than nuclear weapons, governments remain underprepared for that threat (Selk, 2017). Terrorists could be drawn to the use of biological agents because of the difficulty of detection and the ease at which some biological agents can naturally spread through a population (Bioterrorism, 2006). There are essentially three ways which agents could be acquired by terrorist: they could be stolen, created in laboratory environments, or collected naturally. A gloomy reality is that as the advancement of new technologies reduce the costs of genetic sequencing, it will become easier and less expensive to create novel organisms (Garrett, 2012). Bioterrorist attacks can be planned to induce maximum damage and panic with a minimum risk of early detection. Potential agents of attack are categorized by risk (rated as an, A, B, or a C) depending on the agent’s availability, ease of dissemination and transmission, and potential impact (Bioterrorism, 2006). Category A agents are considered the most dangerous and threatening to National Security. Ebola is categorized as a Category A bioagent because of its ability to cause mass panic and disruption and the special public health actions required for treating those infected. Through the EVD, “mother nature has created the perfect bioweapon” (Thiessen, 2014). Following the Paris terrorist attacks, the French have warned that terrorist organizations may attempt to steal biological agents (Talent & Graham, 2016). The British Ministry of Defense feared terrorists would try to acquire EVD and released a report outlining three separate scenarios in which terror groups could successfully weaponize the virus. (Quinn, 2015) These could be stolen from research facilities, laboratories, or government stockpiles. While the more exotic and devastating agents (such as small pox) must be cultivated in laboratory environments and are therefore more difficult to obtain, many biological agents are naturally occurring (Gottron, 2002). Examples of these naturally occurring, and easier to obtain agents include: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the hepatitis strands, yellow fever, and the Ebola virus (Gottron, 2002). Moreover, the Ebola virus is native to a continent where terrorist organizations like Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State are active (Thiessen, 2014). The 21-day incubation period allows potential jihadists more than enough time to infect themselves, then travel to infected population centers, developing the means of mass distribution (Thiessen, 2014). In June 2001 – months prior to the September 11th attack in New York – Dark Winter, a senior level wargame, was run in conjunction with security think tanks and government agencies to simulate government responses to acts of bioterrorism (Dark Winter). The simulation demonstrated how a biological terror attack could result in mass civilian casualties, civil disorder, institutional breakdown and lack of faith in government – compromising national security (Dark Winter). Major challenges for policymakers included the many “fault lines” which existed between governmental agencies, the levels of government, private healthcare systems, and the public (Dark Winter). Breakdowns in centralized leadership and communication could threaten containment and control. It was revealed that the healthcare system in the United States had no surge abilities to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed or to meet the heightened demand for vaccinations (Dark Winter). Finally, targeted communications and information management was recognized as a challenge, both in working with the media and in disseminating important information (Dark Winter). It became very clear after the exercise that the United States was unprepared for an act of bioterrorism. In 2010, nearly ten years after the Dark Winter exercise, a commission created to evaluate the national emergency response capabilities gave the nation a failing grade on its ability to respond to a bioterrorist threat (O’Grady, 2015).

 Answers to: Recruitment Link turn Immigration restrictions don’t fuel terrorist recruitment
Cottee 17 (Simon Cottee, contributing writer for The Atlantic and a visiting senior fellow with the Freedom Project at Wellesley College, FEB 1, 2017, "Trump's Travel Ban Will Not 'Help' ISIS Recruitment," Atlantic, https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/isis-travel-ban-propaganda-trump/515283/
On the crucial matter of moral principle, the conventional liberal wisdom is right: The ban is parochial and un-American and will deal a massive injustice to hundreds of genuine asylum-seekers fleeing war and genocide. But the argument that it will aid ISIS recruitment just doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. First, it contains a contemptible implication about Muslims: namely, that they’re not thinking, reasoning individuals capable of agency, but mere vessels of feeling in a larger geopolitical game between America and the jihadists. From within this
dehumanizing perspective, your average Muslim doesn’t do anything, and he or she certainly doesn’t make things happen. Rather, things are done or happen to them; they are “pushed” or “driven” to extremes by forces beyond their control. They are “inflamed,” “provoked,” “humiliated.” They are, in other words, a negative emotion waiting to happen. The former Islamist and writer Maajid Nawaz calls this “the racism of lowered expectations.” No doubt many Muslims oppose the ban, but the idea that some of the more “vulnerable” among them—to use the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) buzzword—will want to wreak murderous
vengeance for it against their fellow Americans is dangerous. Second, and connectedly, it posits an overly simplistic understanding of jihadist radicalization, linking this exclusively to grievances over domestic and foreign policy. But everything we know about radicalization and terrorism suggests that it is far more complex than this and cannot be reduced to secular political
grievances. Of course these grievances cannot be discounted and are, as Peter Bergen has convincingly concluded in his research on American jihadists, complexly and confusingly mixed with a range of other motives, including religious and personal ones. But it is profoundly misleading to prioritize these above all others in an effort, however understandable, to amplify the idiocy of Trump’s travel ban. Third, it displays a thundering insensitivity to the ironical and contradictory aspect of the whole ban trainwreck. Trump’s ban, argue his critics, has indirectly gifted ISIS propagandists. The main piece of evidence cited for this claim is that a small number of anonymous ISIS fanboys have cited the ban as evidence for the “true” face of an anti-Islamic America. Writing in The Atlantic, the analyst Charlie Winter suggests the possibility that ISIS—at some point—may incorporate the ban as a rallying-theme into its “narrative of victimhood,” even though ISIS has hitherto preferred the register of victory over victimhood, and in spite of the fact that the actual victims of the ban are regarded by ISIS as apostates fit for slaughter. Far from “gifting” ISIS, what the ban has in fact given it is a poisoned chalice. In America, it has generated a raft of critical commentary from leading politicians, and it has provoked a wave of
vociferous protests in major cities that has brought Muslims and non-Muslims together in solidarity. What the ban has done, paradoxically, is solidify the gray zone against which ISIS is fighting. It has revealed not a satanic American face but a pacific and liberal one. As the Lebanese satirist Karl Sharro joked on Twitter, “Trump didn’t think this through. Now there are Friday protests in the US.” This was captioned above a news report with the headline “Detroit Protesters Laid Down Their Protest Signs So Muslims Could Pray.” However ISIS’s leadership decides to spin these displays of solidarity, it is hard to imagine that such symbolically powerful advertisements for the “gray
zone” will be greeted with hand-rubbing glee. Aspiring jihadists, of course, are as eager to slaughter anti-Trump protesters as they are Trump supporters. But it would be a staggering assumption to suppose that Muslims generally are unable to discriminate between good and bad Americans, and that the more cognitively or emotionally impressionable members of the Muslim community will absorb ISIS’s—as yet unvoiced—ban-themed propaganda pitch.
Other factors are way more important for causing radicalization – policy decisions play a small role
Bloomberg 17 (Bloomberg News, 2-10-2017, "Eli Lake: Why it’s naive to argue that Trump’s travel ban is ‘helping’ to create Islamic terrorists," National Post, https://nationalpost.com/opinion/eli-lake-why-its-naive-to-argue-that-trumps- travel-ban-is-helping-to-create-islamic-terrorists
This is a familiar line to anyone who has followed the national security debate since 9/11. Democrats in particular have argued that the Iraq War, the Guantanamo Bay prison and anti-Muslim web videos help to radicalize otherwise peaceful Muslims to murder us at random. Hence Trump’s travel ban is now a “recruitment tool.” If only jihadi recruitment were so easily disrupted. Sadly it’s much more complicated. To start, the process by which an individual gets sucked into the death cults of al Qaeda or the Islamic State cannot be reduced to a single cause. Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, the research director for the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, put it like this: “The argument that the Trump policy will radicalize people is predicated on the flawed premise that people radicalize as a response to government policy. The reality is it’s a highly complex process that involves religious and personal 56
                                    
 factors. A government policy may play a role, but it’s one of many factors.” Meleagrou-Hitchens’s program released an invaluable report last year that studied motivations of Americans who had declared allegiance to the Islamic State. It found that the motivations ranged from sympathy for the plight of Syrians suffering under their dictator’s war to a sense of religious obligation to join a new utopian Islamic caliphate. Another problem with this argument is that it fails to account for the significant rise in radical Islamic
terror under President Barack Obama. He went out of his way to counter the jihadist worldview. He began his presidency by delivering a speech to the Islamic world from Cairo, in which he stressed his own administration’s respect for Islam. He promised, and ultimately failed to, close Guantanamo; he withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, and he scrubbed terms like “radical Islam” and “war on terror” from the government’s lexicon. And yet
despite his efforts, the FBI arrested more Americans for joining Islamic terrorist groups during his presidency
than during that of George W. Bush. And while Obama decimated al Qaeda’s central leadership following the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda’s franchises in Yemen, Somalia and Libya grew stronger. Meanwhile, the Islamic State broke away from al Qaeda during Obama’s presidency and managed to gain territory in Syria and Iraq. Only now has the military campaign to liberate Mosul shown some success.

*Da’ish = ISIS
Individual terrorists and terrorist groups have multiple options to attack the U.S. homeland. First, they can inspire and encourage locals to conduct attacks through magazines like Dabiq (published by Da’ish) and Inspire (published by al Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula). Second, they can infiltrate members into the United States from overseas to conduct attacks or recruit operatives from U.S. communities. Third, they can target aircraft or vessels coming into the United States. In 2010, for example, al Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula attempted to target cargo planes using non-metallic explosive devices hidden in printer cartridges. Russian Metrojet Flight 9268 was not a U.S. bound flight, but—assuming forensic analysis attributes it to Da’ish’s affiliate in Sinai—it demonstrates Da’ish’s desire to strike transportation
targets. Refugees have occasionally been involved in the first two types of terrorist activity in the United States. Perhaps the best-known case involved Waad Ramadan and Alwan Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, who were arrested on federal terrorism charges in 2009 in Bowling Green, Kentucky. They had been granted refugee status, though U.S. government agencies were unaware of their insurgent activities. Upon investigation, their fingerprints were found in a vast store of unprocessed biometric data and the FBI determined both men had been complicit in attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and were continuing to provide support to Iraqi terrorist groups. The Bowling Green arrests led to numerous changes in how the United States processed refugees and asylum-seekers. The process had been haphazard, partly because there were so many refugees and asylum-seekers—including from Iraq—being processed through the system. But there were also challenges because the data were not well organized across the U.S. government.
Impossible to get accurate data on Syrian refugees

There are significant difficulties with properly vetting refugees, particularly from the Middle East. Many come from countries where their home governments are unable or unwilling to help the U.S. with the vetting process, such as areas controlled by the Syrian regime or ISIS, Libya, or other areas with weak or hostile governments

 Answers to: Never Happened Before Terrorist are planning to use the refugee system to execute terrorist attacks

Trump, Refugees, and the Truth, https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/trump-refugees-and-the-truth
To ignore terrorists’ intentions to strike the United States is to ignore reality. While ISIS fighters posing as refugees have not yet attacked the United States, that does not mean they will not. In fact, you can count on them trying. Our enemies are forward-thinking and opportunistic. To be successful, counterterrorism policy must be forward-thinking as well, anticipating 10 steps ahead rather than merely responding to the threats (think shoe-bombers) of the past.

 Minimizing the Relevance of Humanitarian Claims
At face value, it is difficult to minimize the relevance of humanitarian claims. The size of the humanitarian emergency is simply enormous. But even with that conceded (there is no point in arguing it), there are three strong arguments the Pro can make.
One, the Con isn’t making a claim that humanitarian assistance should not be provided. There is humanitarian assistance now and more should certainly be provided by governments, international organizations, and private actors. The Pro supports that. The Pro simply does not support the claim that providing it should outweigh a state’s right to control its borders. And any arguments the Pro makes that we can afford to provide more just means that we can do more without undermining the control of borders.
Three, the Con can argue that a state’s rights to control its own borders should be prioritized, just not in an unlimited manner. Most of the Affirmative’s, "National Interest Bad" evidence will be in the context of treating it as an absolute.

By arguing that the state's posture toward international law should be shaped by a commitment to protecting the basic human rights of all persons, I am plainly rejecting the dominant view in international relations,
namely, that state policy should or at least may exclusively pursue "national interest." According to the conception of justice I lay out in Part One, the state is not merely an instrument for advancing the interests of its own citizens; it is also a resource for helping to ensure that all persons have access to institutions that protect their basic human rights.This is not to deny that state leaders are obligated to accord priority to the interests of their own citizens, of course, but it is to insist that this priority is not without limits.
A limited prioritization of the national interest is certainly justified.
Allen Buchanan, political philosopher at Duke, 2003 Justice, Legitimacy, and Self-Determination: Moral
Foundations for International Law, Kindle Edition, page/location number at end of card
Of course, rejecting the discretionary association model does not entail viewing the state simply as a resource for fulfilling the Natural Duty of Justice. Instead, the same reasons noted in Chapter 1 in favor of having a system of states as opposed to a single world-state speak in favor of constraining the use of state resources for the pursuit suit of global justice by recognizing that the state's resources are to be used first and foremost, though not exclusively, to serve the interests of its own citizens. And there may be a deeper reason why the citizens of a state may rightly assume that their well-being, at least up to a point of reasonable sufficiency, ought to be a priority for their state: It may turn out, as many moral theorists have argued, that any acceptable view of morality will allow a limited priority for our own interests. In other words, the position I am advocating-that we reject the discretionary association view of the state as being incompatible with the Natural Duty of Justice-requires only what Samuel Scheffler has called a moderate cosmopolitanism about justice.13 According to moderate cosmopolitanism, we do have moral obligations beyond our own borders, but these are seen as being compatible with giving special priority to the needs and interests of our fellow citizens. The view is cosmopolitan because it recognizes genuine moral obligations to those outside our own polity, and that for this reason the special priority given to our own polity cannot be absolute. It is moderate because it rejects the extreme cosmopolitan itan position that all of our particular obligations, including our obligations to our fellow citizens, are strictly derivative upon our obligations to humanity at large.

 Europe can’t even keep track of its 88,000 child refugees.
Joseph Ataman, August 1, 2016, Wall Street Journal. Europe is losing track of its child refugees. http://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-is-losing-track-of-child-refugees-1470002526
European governments are losing track of significant numbers of children who have entered the continent without their parents as refugees from war-torn areas in the Middle East and beyond. In Belgium, authorities can’t account for 156 migrant children who entered the country unaccompanied since January 2015, and the number is growing. This year, 90 unaccompanied migrant children have been reported missing to Child Focus, Belgium’s center for missing and sexually exploited children....n 2015, 88,245 unaccompanied children— 91% of them boys—sought asylum in the European Union, and officials estimate that there are as many as 10,000 missing migrant children. This year, 90% of migrant children arriving in Italy were unaccompanied. Advocates say the families of children often pay smugglers in advance but often this depends on their nationality, with poorer migrants from Afghanistan or Eritrea forced to work for smugglers to pay for their passage. .. A 2016 Unicef report detailed the constant threat of sexual violence, forced prostitution and rape for lone migrant children in transit in Northern France, a danger that advocates say exists across Europe. Mr. Lowyck said his center had received several migrant children who had survived rapes on their journeys. “We are always too late, we see kids who are traumatized, beaten, raped. When they arrive in Europe, the most difficult part of their journey begins,” he said. “Some of the worst trauma is happening once they enter Europe,” he said. “Kids are more and more desperate. The smugglers know this.”

 Humanitarian Needs

 General Humanitarian Crisis
A global crisis of displaced persons is risking the lives of 65 million people, and it’s increasing
rapidly
Bagaric, 17 - Lecturer, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia (Brienna Bagaric, Revisiting the Definition of Particular Social Group in the Refugee Convention & Increasing the Refugee Quota as a Means of Ameliorating the International Displaced Person's Crisis, 69 S. C. L. Rev. 121 (2017),
The most pressing and compelling human rights crisis of our time is the massive increase in displaced people over the past decade. There are now more displaced people in the world than at any other time since the Second World War.' Without any hint of exaggeration there is now a monumental international crisis stemming from the more than sixty million people who are now displaced. 2 Regrettably, there is nothing approaching even a tenable, durable solution to this problem. The strain regarding so many displaced people has been felt most acutely in Europe where there are literally millions of people waiting to be hopefully absorbed.3 The likelihood of absorption is greatly diminished following a reversal by Germany the greatest recipient of refugees-regarding its appetite to absorb more refugees.4 However, the crisis now extends to all regions. In September 2016, then-United States President Barack Obama convened a crisis summit in New York to attempt to find solutions to the refugee crisis.5 An important backdrop to this summit is that, since 1975, the United States has resettled more than 3.2 million refugees and increased its annual refugee intake from 70,000 to 110,000.6 The summit was co-hosted by then-United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and a number of countries who are regarded as discharging a considerable disproportionate burden in accommodating refugees. 7 These countries include Sweden, Germany, Canada, and Mexico.' Fifty-two countries participated in the summit.9 The summit followed UN talks several days before, which failed to provide any tenable solutions.1 0 Ultimately, while the summit recognized the desperate need to find ways of dealing with more than sixty million displaced people, it fell well short of providing effective solutions." Recently, the refugee crisis has been significantly exacerbated as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's January 27, 2017 executive order, which bans indefinitely the admission of people fleeing Syria into the United States and temporarily freezes the entry of other refugees for 120 days.12 A federal district court enjoined the ban; however, following a request by the Justice Department to reinstate the ban, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the freeze. 13 At the time of writing this Article, President Trump had signed a revised executive order, which imposes a ninety-day ban on citizens from six countries-Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.14 Further, although the revised order removes the indefinite suspension of Syrian refugee admissions, the order does place a freeze on all refugee entries into the United States (under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program) for at least 120 days.'5 Most notably, President Trump has reduced the 2017 annual refugee quota set by the previous Obama Administration by more than half-from 110,000 to 50,000 under the new order.' 6 The key basis upon which displaced people have been settled since World War II (WWII) is the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention). While the Refugee Convention is the international instrument which has guided the absorption of more refugees than any other document or agreement, it has been well- recognized that it is no longer adequate to deal with the scale and nature of the current crisis. At the same time, it is clear that no international consensus will be reached regarding a wide-ranging and effective response to the refugee problem. Accordingly, the operation and application of the Refugee Convention is more important now than at any time since the drafting of the document. There are several key reasons why the Refugee Convention is not a holistic solution to the refugee problem. One of these reasons obviously relates to the willingness of countries to absorb a far greater amount of refugees than they have done historically. There are also significant legal limitations relating to the Convention which potentially can considerably curtail the number of people who can request asylum under the document. In particular, the Refugee Convention does not on its face apply to all destitute and displaced people. The only people who can qualify as refugees under the Convention are those who are at risk of persecution in their homeland for one of five specified reasons. These reasons are race, nationality, religion, political opinion, and membership of a particular social group.' 7 Displaced people who do not come within the scope of one or more of these five grounds are automatically precluded from invoking the Refugee Convention as a basis for making a claim for asylum in another country. As a result, the interpretation and 66 meaning of these five grounds is more important now than at any other time in human history. In this Article, I examine
                
 the context, background, and meaning that should be accorded to one of these grounds, namely, membership of a particular social group. I focus on this ground because it is the one that is most obscure and devoid of clear jurisprudential analysis. In addition, this ground also potentially offers the greatest prospect of a wide interpretation, thereby potentially resulting in large numbers of asylum seekers being able to increasingly rely on the ground. By way of summary, I conclude that the meaning previously associated with particular social group is far too narrow and under-inclusive. A much broader meaning is appropriate in light of the historical origins of the Refugee Convention and the purpose of the agreement. So I propose a new, wider definition. Expanding the scope of this term will result in a far greater number of displaced people being able to base their claim for asylum on a ground within the scope of the Refugee Convention. II. THE CURRENT DISPLACED PERSON CRISIS A. Overall Picture Regarding the Current Number of Displaced People Recorded human history has long documented the existence of people who are displaced from their homeland and have no place to live. 22 However, the extent of this phenomenon is now at unprecedented levels. Global forced displacement has continued to increase, with more people forced from their homes by war, conflict, generalized violence, and persecution since WWII. 23 The global population of forcibly displaced people today is larger than the population of the United Kingdom.24 In fact, if the total global population of forcibly displaced people today combined to form their own country, it would be the 21st largest country in the world.25 The starkest figures are set out in the UNHCR Global Trends Report (UNHCR Report), which notes that at the end of 2015, 65.3 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide- increasing for the fifth consecutive year.26 This equates to 1 in every 100 people worldwide being displaced from their homes, the highest ratio since 1951 when the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began collecting data on displaced persons. 27 This is 5.8 million more refugees and displaced individuals than the previous year (59.5 million). 28 The rate of increase at which the displaced population is growing is marked over the most recent five- year period. 29 According to UNHCR data, there were 42.5 million forcibly displaced people recorded worldwide in 2011.30 This is a 50% increase in only five years.3 ' Approaching the issue from a somewhat wider lens further highlights the current extent of the crisis. In 1996, there were 37.3 million displaced persons recorded worldwide.32 Thus, the rate of displacement has been rapidly growing over the last twenty years. There are a number of different cohorts that make up the global figure of displaced persons. Broadly, they consist of refugees who account for about 21 million of the displaced persons; internally displaced persons (IDPs) who account for approximately 41 million people; and finally, asylum seekers who account for slightly more than 3 million people. 33 The main entity or institution that monitors and has a broad supervisory or caretaker function in relation to asylum seekers is the UNHCR. 34 Its oversight of displaced people has grown to 52.6 million, compared to 46.7 million at the end of 2014.35 The below table from the UNHCR sets out the large number and rapid increase in displaced people. 36 B. The Significant Recent Increase in the Number of Displaced People The rapid increase in displaced persons is demonstrated by the fluctuation in the most recent calendar year for which the number of displaced people has been reported. During the course of 2015, more than 12.4 million individuals were forced to leave their homes and seek protection elsewhere; of this number, 8.6 million remained within their own countries and around 1.8 million sought international protection abroad. In addition, 2.0 million new claims for asylum were made within the year.3 To further illuminate the marked rate at which the number of displaced persons is increasing, in 2015, approximately twenty-four people in the world became displaced every minute.38 In other terms, every day over 34,000 people were forcibly displaced due to conflict or persecution.39 There were only six persons newly displaced per minute in 2005.40 There have been a number of discrete events which have contributed significantly to the growth in displaced people. For example, the rising prevalence of displaced persons is particularly pronounced in the Syrian Arab Republic. In 2015, there were a total of 11.7 million Syrians displaced both within and outside Syrian borders.4 ' This figure is composed of 4.9 million refugees, 6.6 million IDPs, and nearly 250,000 asylum seekers. 42 However, more recent data suggests that by mid-2016, the total global number of displaced Syrians had already risen to 12.5 million. 43 Afghans, Colombians, Congolese, Iraqis, Nigerians, Somalis, Sudanese, South Sudanese, and Yemenis also comprised significant populations of displaced persons-each with over 2 million. 44 As noted above, one of the largest cohorts of displaced people is refugees. The total number of refugees alone also increased for the fifth consecutive year.45 In the four-year period from 2011 to 2015 (inclusive), the refugee population grew by 55% from 10.4 million to 21.3 million. 46 Further, the UNHCR notes that there were 16.1 million refugees registered under its mandate in 2015.47 Strikingly, this is 1.7 million more recorded refugees than the previous year. 48 As noted by the UNHCR Report, one of the largest contributing factors to this exponential growth has been the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, which began in 2010.49
          67

 The Syrian Arab Republic produced over half of the world's new refugees in 2015.50 There were also an additional 5.2 million Palestinian refugees registered by the UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency).5 1 The significance of the refugee crisis is further underlined by the fact that, by the end of 2015, half of the world's refugees were children (5 1%).52 According to the UNHCR, in 2015, 98,400 asylum claims were made worldwide by children who were either unaccompanied or separated from their families. 53 The number of such applications made in 2014 was 34,300.54 Thus, this is nearly a threefold increase in a single year.55 C. Key Refugee and Displaced Person Producing Countries According to the UNHCR Report, developing countries are the top ten refugee-producing countries.5 6 In fact, 12.2 million (76%) of the 16.1 million refugees registered under the UNHCR's mandate originated from these ten countries alone in 2015.57 Further, most of these countries have produced significant numbers of refugees for at least the past five years. For example, Afghanistan has produced some of the largest numbers of refugees for over thirty years.5 1 As mentioned above, the continued conflict in Syria has resulted in the most profound refugee and displaced persons problem in the world. Six in every ten Syrians are currently displaced this figure is unprecedented in recent history for a single country. 59 In 2015 alone, there were over 1 million newly registered displaced Syrian refugees.60 Thus, as mentioned above, by the end of 2015 there were 4.9 million Syrian refugees worldwide, making the Syrian Arab Republic the largest refugee-producing country. A significant proportion of the total Syrian refugee population is hosted in bordering countries-specifically Turkey (2.5 million), Lebanon (1.1 million), Jordan (628,200), Iraq (244,600), and Egypt (117,600).61 A paradoxical feature relating to these host countries is that they are some of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world. 62 The countries that hosted the largest Syrian refugee population, not located in the bordering region, were Germany and Sweden-115,600 and 52,700, respectively. 63 Syrians also accounted for the largest number of asylum applications registered globally during 2015.64 A total of 373,700 new applications for asylum were made, comprising 18% of the world's total number of applications. This is compared to 12% the previous year. 65 Afghanistan remained the second largest refugee-producing country at the end of 2015; at the time, the Afghan refugee population worldwide was estimated at 2.7 million.66 A significant proportion of these Afghan refugees sought protection in Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran-1.6 million and 951,100, respectively. 67 The third largest country of origin was Somalia, with 1.12 million refugees worldwide in 2015.68 Notably, approximately 54 % of the world's refugees in 2015 originated from only these three countries-Syria, Somalia, and Afghanistan.69 The remaining top ten refugee-producing countries in 2015 were South Sudan (778,700-compared to 616,200 a year earlier), Sudan (628,800), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (541,500), the Central African Republic (471,100), Myanmar (451,800), Eritrea (411,300), and Colombia (340,200).70 D. Poor Countries Continuing to Shoulder a Disproportionate Burden ofAdmitting Displaced People The trend of poor countries shouldering a disproportionate burden of the refugee intake not only applies in relation to Syrian refugees but also to the entire cohort of the refugee population. Turkey was host to the largest refugee population for the second consecutive year hosting 2.54 million refugees in 2015.7' This is also a significant increase from the 1.6 million refugees it hosted in 2014.72 Pakistan and Lebanon were the second and third largest refugee-hosting countries worldwide-1.6 million and 1.1 million refugees, respectively. 73 The below table sets out the top ten refugeehosting countries in 2015, which accounted for almost 60% of the total number of refugees registered under the UNHCR mandate. 74 For the third consecutive year, developing countries have disproportionately hosted almost 90% of all refugees under the UNHCR's mandate.'" By the end of 2015, developing countries hosted 13.9 million of the total global number of refugees under the UNHCR's mandate.716 Moreover, the world's Least Developed Countries (LDCs) hosted 26% of the world's refugee population-that is, 4.2 million refugees." This is in stark contrast to the 2.2 million refugees that developed countries hosted." The pattern of wealthy countries failing to shoulder a reasonable burden of the displaced person crisis is further highlighted in a recent report by Amnesty Intemnational, which states that "wealthy countries have shown a complete absence of leadership and responsibility, leaving just 10 countries, which account for less than 2.5% of world GDP, to take in 56% of the world's refugees."79 In fact, the world's six wealthiest countries (including the United States) hosted less than 9% of the world's total refugee and asylum seeker population in 2015, according to a recent OXFAM report.80 Despite accounting for over half of the global economy (56.6%), the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom combined hosted only 2.1 million refugees and asylum seekers in 2015; Germany hosted the largest share of this population (736,740).1 To further complete the picture regarding countries that most drastically increased their refugee intake in 2015, Turkey registered the largest number of68 new refugees within its borders in 2015, including 946,800 from the Syrian Arab Republic.82 Russia was the second
           
 largest host of newly displaced refugees in 2015, with 149,600 Ukrainian refugees seeking protection within the country. The third largest number (132,400) of refugees sought protection in the United Republic of Tanzania as a result of violence and conflict in neighboring Burundi.8 3 The UNHCR Report also notes that Ethiopia, Rwanda, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda registered significant numbers of new refugees in 2015.84 A similarly dispiriting picture emerges regarding IDPs, which constitute the highest number of displaced people. The total number of IDPs in 2015 was unprecedented almost 41 million. 5 This is 2.6 million more IDPs than in 2014.86 Once again, the countries in which this crisis is occurring are overwhelmingly impoverished countries with fragile political and rule of law institutions. In 2015 alone, 8.6 million people were newly displaced within their own countries as a result of conflict and violence. 87 UNHCR statistics show that 84% of the world's new IDPs were located in only six countries in 2015." The country with the highest number of new IDPs was Yemen where 10% (2.5 million people) of its population was internally displaced in one year. 89 This data shows the continuation of an unremitting pattern whereby the countries that can least afford to absorb and accommodate new arrivals are the ones that are continuing, in increasing numbers, to take in new refugees. A similar picture emerges in relation to asylum seekers. An asylum seeker is an individual who has sought asylum protection but whose claims have yet to be assessed. 90 The UNHCR Report states that at the time of the report, approximately 3.2 million asylum applications were yet to be determined. 9 ' Notably, 2015 saw the highest number of asylum claims submitted in a single year 2.45 million. 92 This compared to 1.66 million in 2014 represents a 58% rise in one year. 93 Further, a considerable proportion of the asylum applications lodged in 2015, over 2 million, were new applications lodged by individuals for the first time. 94 The contrast between refugees and asylum seekers is not so much the general source of these respective communities, but rather the destinations where they are seeking to locate, which are invariably first world, wealthy countries. The country that registered the highest number of new individual asylum applications in 2015 was Germany, with 441,900 claims made. 95 This is an increase of 255% from 2014 when 173,100 people applied for protection in the country. 96 E. Overview of the United States' Response to Accepting Displaced People While most of the top refugee-producing countries have been very remote from the United States, and the United States has not been significantly affected by the refugee crisis, there was a considerable rise in people seeking protection within the United States. 97 According to the UNHCR Report, the United States received the second highest number of new asylum applications in 2015-172,700 compared to 121,200 in 2014.98 This is a 42% increase. 99 Over half of these new asylum applicants originate from Central America, specifically Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala' 00 -an area considered one of the most violent in the world largely due to the prevalence of gang-related crime.' 0 ' Almost 50,000 of these asylum applicants originate from these three countries alone.1 02 A large number of new asylum claims were also made in Sweden and Russia in 2015, 156,000 and 152,500, respectively.1 0 3 The United States received 84,995 refugees in 2016, effectively meeting the 85,000 ceiling set by the Obama Administration at the beginning of the year.1 0 4 The Democratic Republic of the Congo (16,370), Syria (12,587), and Myanmar (12,347) were the top countries of origin of refugees in 2016.105 Together, refugees from these three nations represented nearly half (49%) of all refugees admitted to the United States over the past year.1 06 The above data illustrates a humanistic crisis of almost incalculable magnitude. The crisis is getting worse, and there is no obvious solution. The crisis is reflected not only by the tens of millions of people who are displaced and in desperate need for a new homeland, but is exacerbated by the fact that the countries that are providing temporary accommodations to displaced people are overwhelmingly developing countries that have no capacity to provide meaningful levels of resources that are essential to human subsistence, such as access to healthcare, education, and housing.
Currently, there are millions of refugees living in dire conditions.
Oxfam, 2019, Refugee and Migrant Crisis, https://www.oxfam.org/en/emergencies/refugee-and-migrant-crisis
The global refugee crisis has created a number of immediate humanitarian crises. As discussed above, there are more than 68 million refugees on the move world-wide, creating a humanitarian crises that leaves many subject to unlivable conditions. More than 65 million people around the world are now officially displaced from their homes by conflict, violence and persecution – the highest figure recorded by the United Nations since the 69 Second World War. In 2017, more than 170,000 migrants, including refugees, arrived in Europe by sea.
               
 Close to 120,000 of them crossed the Central Mediterranean, the migrant route with most deaths recorded in the world, and nearly 2,900 migrants recorded killed or missing on that route in the same year. Most of them traveled on smugglers’ boats departing from Libya, Tunisia or Egypt, risking their lives in search of safety in Italy and beyond. However, the vast majority of people are displaced within their country of origin, or remain close to it. In Nigeria, the ongoing conflict with Boko Haram has forced 1.8 million people to flee their homes and search for safety in other parts of the country. Lebanon, with a population of 4.5 million people, is struggling to host 1.2 million Syrian refugees. A growing number of them are living in difficult conditions in camps or amongst host communities on the borders of both Turkey and Jordan. Idomeni refugee camp, in Greece.Idomeni refugee camp, Greece, March 2016. Photo: Pablo Tosco/Oxfam Unsafe conditions for people arriving Many of the migrants and refugees reaching Europe face daily uncertainty and practical challenges, from the lack of basic information to the increasing risk posed by human trafficking and migrant smuggling. European border closures and restrictions as well as the implementation of the EU-Turkey deal have dramatically worsened the situation for these vulnerable people and created a humanitarian crisis. Thousands of them have been left stranded in Greece, many of them in abysmal conditions in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands and with no access to family members who reside in other countries; others are stuck in Macedonia and Serbia, or pushed back from one country to the other. Having made a perilous journey across the Mediterranean, those who arrive in Italy and Greece hoped to find sanctuary. Instead, they find themselves living in often overcrowded sites that lack food and basic services such as medical care, water and sanitation. In the Balkans countries many women, men and children are being mistreated by law enforcement officials who use violence and intimidation to illegally push them back and deny them access to asylum procedures. Refugees and other migrants who have crossed from Libya tell of rape, torture and slave labor as daily realities that people crossing the North-African country face.
This could be solved with more aggressive resettlement/safe haven programs.
Allison Proud, April 21, 2016, Desert News, Why the 500 refugees killed in last week’s shipwreck may be part of the “new normal” http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865652662/Why-the-500-refugees-killed-in-last-weeks- shipwreck-may-be-part-of-a-new-normal.html?pg=all DOA: 4-21-16
Up to 50 migrants may have died in a shipwreck in the Mediterranean Sea last week when an overcrowded vessel capsized, according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. "My wife and baby drowned in front of me," one of the 41 survivors told the BBC. The migrants, who were fleeing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Egypt, had paid a smuggler to take them by boat from Libya's northern coast to Italy. Rather than feeling relief and joy at seeing dry land in Greece following their rescue, however, the survivors were angry and at first refused to disembark, the BBC reported, because they wanted to reach Italy, not Greece. Hundreds of thousands of migrants stranded in Greece are set to be turned away under a recent deal struck between the EU and Turkey. The deal has made entering Europe through Greece less viable, squeezing migration flows westward as refugees and migrants seek new routes into Europe. Instead of the short sea crossing from Turkey to Greece, more migrants are attempting the longer — and more deadly — Libya-to-Italy and Morocco-to-Spain crossings, according to Quartz. The number of refugees who attempted to cross to Italy during the first three months of 2016 was 85 percent higher than in 2015, Newsweek reported, with 18,795 people so far this year undertaking the voyage that claims the lives of 1 in 92 people who attempt it. The regular flow of migrants across the Mediterranean is a "new normal," Daniela Segreto, who leads a special initiative for immigration in Sicily, told Quartz. “It’s an unstoppable phenomenon that we can only try and manage." In anticipation of increasing numbers attempting the Libya crossing, the EU is continuing anti-trafficking operations in the Mediterranean Sea, turning over suspected smugglers to Italian authorities and destroying their boats, according to Newsweek. But the EU is not allowed within 69 miles of the Libyan coast, and many smugglers abandon boatloads of refugees at the edge of Libyan waters before turning back to Libya, where they are unlikely to be arrested. One solution, according to UNHCR, would be to create more regular pathways for the admission of refugees into Europe, "including
                      70
   
 resettlement and humanitarian admission programmes, family reunification, private sponsorship and student and work visas for refugees. These will all serve to reduce the demand for people smuggling and dangerous irregular sea journeys." In a May 2015 Ted Talk, Melissa Fleming, head of communications for UNHCR, recounted the harrowing story of Doaa, a young Syrian refugee who survived for four days floating in the Mediterranean before she was rescued after a similar accident. Fleming asked: "What if she didn't have to take that risk? Why did she have to go through all that? Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe? ... Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees, the victims of the worst war of our times? The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now? Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees? And why, the root question, is so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe? "One thing is for sure, that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are. And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children. And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate." The tragedy last week happened almost exactly one year to the day after the worst recorded sea accident since the beginning of the migrant crisis. "It is a haunting coincidence and a reminder of just how desperate people are — not (only) to escape war but to escape from poverty," wrote Will Ross for the BBC. "As for the traffickers who are making money overloading the boats — are they not mass murderers, too?"
Children are left vulnerable to traffickers because of a lack of safe havens for refugees.
The News, April 16, 2016, Child Refugees in Europe Need Protection from Traffickers, http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/112201-Child-refugees-in-Europe-need-protection-from-traffickers DOA: 4-16- 16
Europe’s refugee crisis has created a "huge business opportunity" for human traffickers, and governments should widen the legal routes of entry to protect refugee children, the UN children’s agency (Unicef) said on Tuesday. The number of children on the move in Europe has been rising and children now account for more than one-third of all refugees and migrants - compared with just one in 10 in June 2015 - and many are travelling alone, according to Unicef figures. "We know that (child protection and monitoring systems) are well over-stretched and overwhelmed and they need to be strengthened," Sarah Crowe, Unicef’s global spokeswoman on the European refugee and migrant crisis, told a media briefing in London. "They need to make sure that they’ve got a proper system in place with guardianship, with child protection officers who are able to determine where (children’s) best interests are and how to reunify them with family otherwise they will abscond and be preyed upon. "More than one million people fleeing conflict poured into Europe, mainly through Greece, last year. The European Union is implementing an accord under which all new arrivals in Greece will be sent back to Turkey if they do not meet asylum criteria. In 2015, 95,000 children who sought asylum in Europe were not accompanied by an adult, Crowe said, adding that this vastly underestimated the number who arrived as many children avoided registering with the authorities from fear of being detained. Unregistered children were not covered by any child protection services and so were most vulnerable to violence, abuse and exploitation, according to Unicef. "We know that thousands and thousands of children are simply unaccounted for and the most horrifying thing of all is we just have no idea where they are or what’s happening to them," Unicef deputy executive director Lily Caprani told the briefing. "It’s that complete absence of information that should terrify us the most." Crowe said that although not all children who were unaccounted for were necessarily being exploited by human traffickers, Europe should strengthen child protection systems and widen legal routes such as family reunification. She said that as the migrant route to Europe through the Balkan countries seemed to be shut, people would find alternative and more dangerous routes. "That’s why we are saying there has to be a safe and legal alternative," Crowe said. "We’re calling for alternatives such as humanitarian visas, scholarship grants that can be seen as ways in especially for young people."
This problem is magnified when countries close their borders.
Joint Agency Briefing Note (Oxfam et al), April 14, 2016 A safe haven? Britain’s role in protecting people on the move, http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/a-safe-haven-britains-role-in-protecting-people-on-the- 71 move-605192 DOA: 4-21-16
               
 Arbitrary border closures cause untold suffering. People trapped at borders will take greater risks, and are more likely to put their lives into the hands of smugglers. They are more vulnerable to disease, family separation and human rights abuses. People who have exhausted their resources may be at higher risk of being subjected to gender-based violence and exploitation as they continue their journey through Europe. In this situation, children and women are left extremely vulnerable, and accounts of exploitation along the journey to and within Europe are manifold.
Absent a safe haven in Europe or the United States, many refugees will continue to suffer from
inadequate medical care and food supplies.
EU Observor, September 25, 2015, Six EU States Slash Food Aid for Syrian Refugees, https://euobserver.com/migration/130400 DOA: 9-25-15
Every member state, except the Netherlands, has slashed contributions to the World Food Progamme
(WFP) in 2015. EU leaders at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday (23 September) are being asked to shore up contributions. The drastic cuts over the past year mean the UN agency has been unable to hand out food vouchers to hundreds of thousands of Syrians at refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey. The lack of food and deplorable conditions at the camps is, in part, compelling many to take the journey to the EU. At the camp in Jordan, some 229,000 Syrians stopped receiving food aid in September. In Turkey, around 60,000 women gave birth in the camps since the start of the conflict. WFP has since had to halve assistance to almost 1.3 million Syrian refugees in the region. Most live off $0.50 a day. The agency is warning that disruptions to water supplies could provoke major outbreaks of disease. “Faced with such harsh conditions who can blame people for seeking a safe haven in Europe”, said European parliament president Martin Schulz. Austria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, and Slovakia made the most drastic cuts. All sliced their contributions by 100 percent this year, compared to last year. Sweden’s contribution dropped by 95 percent, followed by Lithuania at 69.5 percent, and Belgium at 54.7 percent. The UK also dropped by 29.5 percent. Others like Croatia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania gave nothing in the past two years. The Netherlands stands alone as the only member state, at plus 5.8 percent, which has increased contributions. It means member state contributions went from €895 million in 2014 to €675 million this year, a 38 percent drop. But Sweden, for its part, contested the 95 percent drop in figures given by the European Commission. It says it usually makes the disbursements quite late in the year, which was not reflected in the commission's data. "The Swedish contribution for 2015 at the moment stands at $69.3 million. This is without the increase just announced, which takes the total to about $72.3 million", said a contact at Sweden's ministry of international development cooperation. The WFP said Sweden's contribution was registered last week.
More than a million refugees are in dire need of an immediate safe haven.
Amnesty International, July 5, 2016, The Global Refugee Crisis – Genuine Responsibility Sharing – Amnesty International’s Five Proposals, https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior40/4380/2016/en/
More than one million refugees are considered by UNHCR to be vulnerable and urgently in need of resettlement to other countries. Vulnerable refugees include survivors of violence and torture, women and girls at risk, and those with serious medical needs. Only around 30 countries offer resettlement places for vulnerable refugees, and the number of places offered (known as “resettlement places”) annually falls far short of the needs identified by UNHCR.
If refugees are forced to go back to (or stay in) Syria, they will die.

 This development will likely intensify a bitter argument. One side believes it's important to provide shelter to thousands of helpless people who may die if they remain in Syria. The other side believes letting in Syrian war refugees will put host countries at greater risk for terrorist attacks. Vetting every incoming refugee would require huge resources. It likely would slow down a widening river of refugees that has already posed logistical problems in many nations. Just look how slowly the European Union is moving on its promise to relocate refugees: As of a few days ago, the EU had only relocated 147 of 160,000. But the other end of the spectrum, closing borders to Syrian war refugees could force many Syrians to remain at home -- exposing them to deadly fighting between anti-government rebels and government forces. Many feel they must leave the region to save their lives.

 Refugee Camps Most of the refugees are living in camps
The Observor, January 6, 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/observer-view-on-britain- failing-in-moral-duty-to-help-refugees The Observer view on Britain failing dismally in its moral duty to help refugees
Meanwhile, Europe is being put to shame by the much poorer countries that neighbour conflict regions. Out of 6 million Syrian refugees, more than 5 million are resident in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Almost nine in 10 displaced people around the world are hosted by developing countries. And some of these countries are taking far more humane and generous approaches. Uganda, home to more than a million refugees, allows them the right to work and freedom of movement. Research has shown both refugees and host communities have benefited.
Camps don’t solve the humanitarian problems and are breading grounds for terrorists
Gulf News, August 25, 2018, In search of a new deal for refugees, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/refugee-camps-integration.html
For many years now, groups that work with refugees have fought to put an end to the refugee camp. It's finally starting to happen. Camps are a reasonable solution to temporary dislocation. But refugee crises can go on for decades. Millions of refugees have lived in their country of shelter for more than 30 years. Two-thirds of humanitarian assistance -- intended for emergencies -- is spent on crises that are more than eight years old. Camps are stagnant places. Refugees have access to water and medical care and are fed and educated, but are largely idle. "You keep people for 20 years in camps -- don't expect the next generation to be problem-free," said Xavier Devictor, who advises the World Bank on refugee issues. "Keeping people in those conditions is not a good idea." It's also hard to imagine a better breeding ground for terrorists. "As long as the system is 'we feed you,' it's always going to be too expensive for the international community to pay for," Devictor said. It's gotten more and more difficult for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to raise that money; in many crises, the refugee agency can barely keep people from starving. It's even harder now as nations turn against foreigners - even as the number of people fleeing war and violence has reached a record high. At the end of last year, nearly 70 million people were either internally displaced in their own countries, or had crossed a border and become a refugee. That is the largest number of displaced in history -- yes, more than at the end of the Second World War. The vast majority flee to neighbouring countries -- which can be just as badly off.
Temporary camps will not solve the problem.
Ashley Welch, September 25, 2015, Amid crisis, refugees face numerous health risks, CBS News, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amid-crisis-refugees-face-numerous-health-risks/ DOA: 9-25-15
The current refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe has seen millions of people flee their homes amid horrific violence. While escaping immediate threats is their first priority, experts say displaced people go on to face numerous health risks, from trauma injuries to disease-causing pathogens to mental illness. And a new report from Jane's Intelligence Review cautions of the danger of potential outbreaks among refugees and, to a lesser extent, host populations. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the civil war in Syria has left 12.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. More than 7 million Syrians are internally displaced and over 4 million are registered as refugees living outside the country. Deteriorating security in Afghanistan, Libya and Yemen, as well as dire living conditions for refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, have also increased the number of people seeking safe haven in the European Union. "For the refugees coming by boat, the immediate health concerns are exposure, dehydration, and if there's capsizing, there's going to be the risk of drowning or near-drownings," Dr. E. Anne Peterson, Senior Vice 74 President of Global Programs at AmeriCares, a disaster relief organization that has delivered millions of dollars in
                 
 medical aid to the region, told CBS News. "There's also a portion of refugees who end up in local communities with relatives or places that are culturally similar where they're squatting, so there's overcrowding and displacing of the health care resources available there," she said. "These refugees embedded in host communities are also not always eligible for health care services, making them particularly vulnerable because they're not in the refugee camps where refugee organizations typically go." Refugee camps present a host of their own health problems, including over-crowding, inadequate access to water and poor sanitation services. This can subsequently lead to outbreaks, such as cholera and typhoid.
Refugee camps often aggravate the situation.

Today, over 12 million people are displaced due to the ongoing conflict in Syria which is now in its 5th
year. Most of Europe is apprehensive about accepting refugees, forcing many to shelter in refugee camps. Refugee camps are jointly administered by governments, UN agencies such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organizations which are tasked with providing necessary services. They act as temporary shelters and hosts for refugees until they are granted asylum in neighboring countries or return to their own country. Shockingly, the refugee shelters have lasted for years, and have become permanent housing rather than temporary settlements. The conditions of these refugee camps are, to say the least, deplorable. Refugees are forced to live in acute poverty, while vulnerable to diseases and physical abuses. Most of the refugee camps fail to provide adequate food, hygiene and clean water and most of the basic necessities for human survival. There is overcrowding in almost every camp as international aid organizations and other development agencies continue to wrestle with the host countries for finances. This fact is especially evident in the wake of Syrian refugee crisis. People are forced to survive on one meal a day and new born infants are wrapped in plastic instead of warm blankets...Since the refugee camps of today became operational, the conditions have deteriorated, lacking access to clean water, food, and shelter, and are vulnerable to physical abuses, human rights abuses, sexual exploitation and rape.

 Lack of Education
Millions of refugees without educational opportunities
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, August 29, 2018, Millions of Refugee Children Going Without Schooling, UNHCR Report Shows, https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2018/8/5b862f424/millions-refugee-children- schooling-unhcr-report-shows.html
Burundi refugee children at Furaha Primary School in Nduta Refugee Camp in western Tanzania, study in a makeshift classroom under the trees. UNHCR/Georgina Goodwin Four million refugee children do not attend school, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, says in a report released today. This is an increase of half a million of out-of-school refugee children in just one year. The report, Turn the Tide: Refugee Education in Crisis, shows that, despite the efforts of governments, UNHCR and its partners, enrolment of refugee children in school is failing to keep pace with the growing refugee population. By the end of 2017, there were more than 25.4 million refugees around the world, 19.9 million of them under UNHCR's mandate. More than half - 52 per cent - were children. Among them, 7.4 million were of school age. "Education is a way to help children heal, but it is also key to rebuilding their countries," said Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees. "Without education, the future of these children and their communities will be irrevocably damaged." Only 61 per cent of refugee children attend primary school, compared to 92 per cent of children globally. As refugee children get older, this gap grows. Nearly two thirds of refugee children who go to primary school do not make it to secondary school. In total, 23 per cent of refugee children attend secondary school, compared to 84 per cent of children globally. At tertiary level, the gap becomes a chasm. Globally, enrolment in higher education stands at 37 per cent, while only one per cent of refugees have the same opportunity - a figure that has not changed in three years. "

 Lebanon – Syrian Refugees
70,000 Syrian refugees at risk in Lebanon camps as winter sets in, 40,000 are children
Barbara Bibbo, January 10, 2019, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/syrian-refugees-risk-extreme-weather-hits- lebanon-190110184315430.html Syrian refugees at risk as extreme weather hits Lebanon
Geneva, Switzerland - The lives of 70,000 Syrian refugees in makeshift camps across Lebanon are at risk as the country faces extreme weather conditions and flooding, the United Nations' refugee protection agency has said. A heavy storm with colder temperatures and high winds, dubbed Norma by Lebanese meteorologists, has affected some 11,301 refugees at 361 different sites across Lebanon since Sunday. "These exceptional weather conditions are making the living situation of Syrian refugees even more precarious," said Philippe Lazzarini, UN resident and humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon, on Thursday. According to the UN, 40,000 of those at risk are children. They live across 850 sites that may also be hit by storms in the next few days. UN agencies have been trying to provide emergency aid to the worst affected areas. In Beirut and the Mount Lebanon region, some refugee camps have collapsed under the heavy snow, while others suffered from flooding or heavy water leakages. In these regions, UN agencies in coordination with local authorities and other NGOs are distributing core relief items, such as winter clothing, mattresses and blankets. In the North and Akkar regions, heavy rainfalls and flash floods have affected some 1,750 refugees. Relief agencies are providing clean water and hygiene kits along with other emergency items, including food parcel distribution, to the families in need. The situation is particularly difficult in the Bekaa and Baalbek regions, which have been hit by torrential rains and heavy snowfalls. A total of 315 sites are at risk, including 117 which are being prioritised, with people in need of shelter and water. READ MORE UN says 250,000 refugees could return to Syria in 2019 In Arsal, refugees are running out of food and some settlements at high altitudes are particularly difficult to reach, said the UN.

1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Most are not able to return to Syria
Barbara Bibbo, January 10, 2019, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/syrian-refugees-risk-extreme-weather-hits- lebanon-190110184315430.html Syrian refugees at risk as extreme weather hits Lebanon
Syrian refugees
About 1.5 million refugees are estimated to be living in Lebanon, where one in every four inhabitants is a refugee, said the UN coordinator. The figure includes some 31,502 Palestinian refugees from Syria, 35,000 Lebanese returnees and a pre-existing population of more than 277,985 Palestinian refugees. Lazzarini, whose office works closely with Damascus over voluntary repatriations, said the eight-year conflict in Syria and stalemate over its political resolution meant it was difficult for most Syrian refugees to consider returning home. "The conditions haven't been met yet for most of the refugees to consider it safe to go back to Syria," he said. In 2018, between 16,000 and 17,000 refugees returned home voluntarily, a slight increase compared with 2017 when 13,000 returned. "With these figures, we are far from any mass returns. If the refugees prefer to face dire living conditions rather than returning home, it means we don't have the right conditions for them to go back," Lazzarini said. Syrians who are willing to return have to contact the Syrian Internal Security, which vets their requests. Once their return has been approved, the UN agency assists the refugees on their journey back, said the UN coordinator. However, many refugees still fear being arrested or persecuted upon their return home. For its part, the Lebanese government has said that refugees will not be forcibly repatriated. "While the integration of refugees is not an option, Lebanon has agreed to a non-refoulment policy," Lazzarini confirmed. Nevertheless, fearing that refugees may settle down permanently, Lebanese authorities have banned the construction of proper camps with permanent structures and services, and have imposed restrictions on the materials to be used. The refugees have ended up in precarious makeshift sites which can hardly withstand extreme weather conditions.

 Large numbers of refugees are undermining Lebanon’s economy
Barbara Bibbo, January 10, 2019, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/syrian-refugees-risk-extreme-weather-hits- lebanon-190110184315430.html Syrian refugees at risk as extreme weather hits Lebanon
Economy
The high number of refugees has taken its toll on the country's economy as well as on its social fabric, with tensions rising between local communities and the refugees. Lazzarini said competition between the two groups over low- income jobs and the discriminatory measures adopted by some municipalities are exacerbating friction between the host community and the Syrian refugees. The prolonged political deadlock over the formation of a new government in Lebanon is also worsening an already bleak economic outlook. The international community has responded to the Lebanese refugee crisis with average annual funding of $1.2bn since the crisis began in 2014. The funds have been used mainly for emergency aid and for the education of refugee children. But 75 percent of all refugees still live under the poverty line and half of these in extreme poverty.

 Mexico/General Latin America
US limits on refugees from Latin American are creating refugee camps in Mexico with terrible living conditions
Ion Grillo, December 21, 2018, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/opinion/the-mexican-border-as-refugee-camp.html New York Times, The Mexican Border as a Refugee Camp
When I was in Tijuana last month, a heavy rainstorm poured down on the Benito Juárez sports park, where more than 6,000 Central American migrants were crowded into tents, under tarps, or simply sleeping on the mud. The rain mixed with sewage that was leaking from broken toilets, forming putrid puddles that seeped into the tents and prompted a vain scramble for dry spaces. I saw one young mother squatting in filthy water, trying to comfort her sick baby. The city government eventually closed the park because of the unsanitary conditions. The men, women and children who have traveled north in a stream of caravans in recent months have grabbed attention because it is unusual for people to move through Mexico together in such large numbers. It’s even more unusual for them to have to seek temporary shelter in such awful conditions. There are refugee camps in many places in the world, but that one existed right next to the American border, where its occupants could literally see California, is disturbing. I’m worried that such scenes will come to seem normal. The Trump administration’s announcement on Thursday that it will make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their court cases are resolved in the United States makes this very likely. ADVERTISEMENT Mexico has increasingly become a transit country for refugees and migrants — especially those fleeing gang violence and government crackdowns in Central America. This puts it in a similar position to Turkey and Italy, where the passage of refugees and migrants has caused enormous domestic problems. Those fleeing Central America often face a level of violence akin to what we think of as occurring in war zones. I have talked to refugees who have been shot, raped, extorted, kidnapped and had their houses burned down by gangs allied with corrupt police officers. The latest move could potentially cause hundreds of thousands of them to pile up along the Mexican side of the border. With thousands of asylum applications being made every month, and with a huge backlog in United States immigration courts, migrants’ cases could take years to resolve. This is your last free article. Subscribe to The Times The new Trump administration rule would strand them in crime-stricken Mexican states. Two Honduran teenagers from the caravan were murdered in Tijuana, officials said Tuesday. It also raises the question of who will support the refugees, who are being helped here by churches, charities and some local governments that already complain they are short on money. “How is Mexico suddenly going to support hundreds of thousands of non-Mexicans for years?” asked the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy organization, in a statement on its website in response to Thursday’s announcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen claims the move will prevent people from using asylum applications to get into the United States and slip into the shadows. “Aliens trying to game the system to get into our country illegally will no longer be able to disappear into the United States, where many skip their court dates,” she said on Thursday. Studies show, however, that the vast majority of asylum seekers show up for their hearings. Editors’ Picks The Itsy-Bitsy, Teenie-Weenie, Very Litigious Bikini ‘I Don’t Want My Writing to Be Charming’ As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, Their Tenants Paid a Price ADVERTISEMENT The move may well be challenged in United States courts. But will Mexico also oppose it? On Thursday, it sent mixed signals. The Foreign Ministry initially said in a statement it would accept those with United States court dates, but then the head of Mexico’s immigration institute said it was legally and logistically impossible to do so. Since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power on Dec. 1, he has been trying to develop a long-term strategy for the crisis. On Dec. 10, his foreign minister promised that Mexico will invest $30 billion in Central America over five years in a “Marshall Plan” aimed at curbing the march northward, including increasing jobs in southern Mexico. He has said he is looking to work with Washington on such a plan. Cooperation on finding a regional solution to the causes of the exodus would be a big step forward. But Mexico should not agree to house United States asylum seekers as part of any 79 bigger deal. This would leave refugees in a painful, drawn-out limbo. The growth of long-term refugee camps along the
                  
 border could also cause resentment among Mexicans, who are already questioning their obligations toward the caravan members. And it could lead to more conflict between frustrated refugees and border guards that snarl border crossing points, hurting the millions of people who rely on cross-border commerce and travel. The scenes of border guards firing tear gas into Mexico and migrants in sewage-filled water next to the United States should not be something we become accustomed to seeing. This should not become our new normal.

 Venezuela More than 3 million Venezuelan refugees
Aviva Shayader, January 10, 2019, False Paradise: Caribbean Island-Nations Must Respect Venezuelans’ Rights https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/community/2019/01/10/false-paradise-caribbean-island-nations-must-respect- venezuelans-rights
In the context of the 3 million Venezuelans who have been displaced by the crisis, a figure of more than 40,000 in Trinidad might not sound significant. However, the island-nation has a population of 1.3 million, so it is hosting more Venezuelans per capita than most other countries. Given Trinidad’s and other Caribbean countries’ close historic ties with Venezuela, they have afforded few rights and protections to the displaced. In Trinidad, even with refugee status, Venezuelans are afforded only three rights: the right to not be deported, freedom of movement and family reunification. With the U.N. projecting that the number of Venezuelans in need of protection will grow this year to nearly 3.6 million, the island cannot ignore its responsibility to respond to the crisis on its doorstep. On the ground, our team heard from many who had been in the detention system that conditions in the detention center are grave, and that there is overcrowding. Detainees have reported suffering or witnessing beatings at the hands of detention guards. They have limited access to health care. Others reported that they can access natural sunlight for only 15 minutes twice a week. Currently, there’s no oversight or accountability by outside observers, including UNHCR. Some people are kept in detention for months on end, and some are even transferred to the island’s maximum-security prison or women’s prison. As one asylum seeker told us, “They may call it a detention center, but it’s a jail, too.”
5500 refugees leave Venezuela every day
UN Human Rights Agency, December 14, 2018, https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2018/12/5c136d834/emergency-plan- refugees-migrants-venezuela-launched.html Emergency plan for refugees and migrants from Venezuela launched
Faced with the largest population outflow in Latin America of recent years, 95 organizations covering 16 countries have been working together to establish a comprehensive response to the urgent needs of millions of refugees and migrants from Venezuela, and host communities. This effort is coordinated by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and IOM, the International Organization for Migration. Launched today in Geneva, the regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) is the first of its kind in the Americas: an operational blueprint, coordination template and strategy for responding to the needs of Venezuelans on the move and securing their social and economic inclusion in the communities receiving them. The RMRP, which is also an appeal for funding, focuses on four key areas: direct emergency assistance, protection, socio-economic and cultural integration and strengthening capacities in the receiving countries. “This plan is a call to the donor community, including international financial institutions and development actors who can play a key role in this situation, to increase their support to refugees and migrants in the region and the host communities which have kindly opened their arms to them,” said Eduardo Stein, Joint UNHCR-IOM Special Representative for Venezuelan refugees and migrants. “Venezuelans I met during my visits spoke of hunger, lack of access to medical care, insecurity, threats, fear. They are families, women alone, children, young boys and girls, all in conditions of extreme vulnerability. All of them saw no other option than to leave their country –sometimes walking for days- seeking to live in dignity and to build a future,” Stein said, adding that this critical situation is exacerbated by the lack of livelihoods, which exposes refugees and migrants to all forms of exploitation. Although Venezuelans have been leaving their country for several years, these movements increased in 2017 and further accelerated in 2018. According to available estimates, during 2018 an average of 5,500 people have been leaving the country every day. “The solidarity of Latin American countries with Venezuelans has been humbling. It is now vital that we stabilize the dire humanitarian situation affecting the millions of Venezuelans seeking protection and shelter across the continent,” said UN
               81

 High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “The appeal launched today underscores the urgency of this complex and fast-evolving situation and the need to support the host communities. ” RMRP funding requirements in 2019 amount to US$ 738 million. Interventions will target 2.7 million people in 16 countries, 2.2 million of them Venezuelans and 500,000 people in host communities. “IOM is committed to expanding its support to governments across Latin America and the Caribbean who have extended assistance and solidarity to Venezuelan migrants over the past year,” IOM Director General António Vitorino said. “We call on the donor community to generously support this regional plan.” Solidarity and responsibility-sharing from the international community are desperately needed, not only for Venezuelan nationals, but also for the governments and citizens of destination countries. They have been at the forefront of the response to the outflow, including through regional initiatives such as the Quito Process, and have demonstrated extraordinary generosity towards the refugees and migrants, in some cases for years. Their ability to cope and their infrastructure are being stretched beyond capacity. “There are significant gaps and challenges, particularly regarding documentation, regularization, capacity of asylum systems, and access to basic services such as health and education, shelter and protection,” said Mr. Stein.

 Africa 15% of refugees in northern Africa are kidnapped
Rebecca Radcliffe, January 9, 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/09/refugees-at-high- risk-of-kidnapping-in-horn-of-africa-research-reveals Refugees at high risk of kidnapping in Horn of Africa, research reveals
More than 15% of refugees travelling north through the Horn of Africa were kidnapped during their journey last year, according to what is believed to be one of the most comprehensive surveys of migration journeys. Researchers from the Mixed Migration Centre (MMC), who conducted 11,150 interviews across 20 countries and seven migration routes, warned that kidnappings may be increasing and identified people travelling through the Horn of Africa to north Africa and Europe as the most vulnerable. While previous reports have highlighted the issue of refugee kidnappings, most of the information was anecdotal. This is the first large survey to provide percentage figures. The research will inform policy responses on the ground, and contribute to the development of a dashboard system to forecast future migration patterns. Advertisement Bram Frouws, head of the MMC, which is part of the Danish Refugee Council, said the hardening of borders had left people even more vulnerable to abuse by smugglers, who often work alongside or with tacit permission from state officials. “Usually, families receive a phone call from kidnappers saying they have their family member and demanding a ransom. Sometimes they can hear the voice or even the torture happening on the phone to force them to pay,” said Frouws. Ransoms are often about $2,000 (£1,570). It is possible that smugglers are increasingly turning to kidnapping as they look for alternative sources of income because of the decreasing number of people travelling through certain routes, he added. “As numbers are going down – at least the number arriving in Europe is going down – as a result of attempts to stop or control this migration, this means there are fewer clients for smugglers,” Frouws said. “Maybe some of them are earning less or being pushed out of business. This could be a way to make it up.” Almost all the victims are held with the threat of or actual use of violence, and most are physically restrained. The research showed that, while travelling through the Horn of Africa, some nationalities are much more vulnerable than others. Almost one in five of the 1,200 Ethiopians interviewed said they had been kidnapped at least once during their journey. Of the 288 Sudanese people interviewed along the same route, 4% said they had been kidnapped. Researchers believe this may be because most kidnappings take place in the Sudan, and that Sudanese people might be better at circumventing the risks, or that they might be starting their journeys beyond the most dangerous areas. 'My heart is split': capturing the essence of exodus – in pictures Researchers surveyed people as they passed through key migration hubs between May 2017 and September 2018. The sample is not representative because there is little concrete data on the absolute numbers of people on the move worldwide, but researchers say the findings are indicative of the horrific abuses suffered by many. Across all migration routes, 615 people reported that they had been kidnapped at least once. Researchers found the second most dangerous route was from Afghanistan to Europe, where around 8% of people reported they had been kidnapped at some stage along their journey. Frouws said the dehumanisation of refugees by politicians or the media was making it easier for smugglers to carry out such crimes. “The more they are dehumanised, there’s less and less outrage over this kind of inhumane treatment,” said Frouws. “Media articles talking about tides of migrants, waves of migrants, migrants streaming into Britain – all of this really dehumanises people and presents migration as something that is really out of control.” Last week, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, appeared to suggest that he would make it harder for people to seek asylum, a right enshrined in international law, in order to deter people from crossing the Channel. He was also criticised for repeatedly referring to people making the Channel crossing as “illegal” migrants. It is not against the law to seek asylum.

 Palestine
 Millions of Palestinian refugees
Palestine News & Information Agency (WAFA), August 28, 2018 , Palestine refugees: Beyond the numbers, https://www.un.org/unispal/document/unrwa-release-annual-report-on-health-of-palestine-refugees-unrwa-press- release/
According to the annual statistics of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) 2018, the number of official Palestinian refugee camps recognized by UNRWA is 12 in Lebanon, 10 in Jordan, 9 in Syria, 19 in the West Bank, and 8 in the Gaza Strip. The number of refugees registered with UNRWA in 2017 was 5.9 million, representing the minimum number of Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian refugees residing in the West Bank registered with UNRWA in 2017 accounted for 17% of the total number of refugees registered with UNRWA, compared to 24.4% in the Gaza Strip. In the Arab countries, the percentage of Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA in Jordan was 39.0% of the total Palestinian refugees, while 9.1% in Lebanon and 10.5% in Syria. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), the number of refugees in 2017 represents 43% of the total population in the State of Palestine, and 26.6% of the population in the West Bank are refugees, while the percentage of refugees in the Gaza Strip is 66.2%. The statistics indicate that the Palestinian refugee population is young, with 39.9% of the total population in Palestine in 2017 are below 15 years of age, which is 39.3% of the total refugee population, and 38.6% of total non-refugees. The percentage of elderly persons aged 60 and over was 4.9% of the total refugee population in the State of Palestine, while the percentage of non-refugees reached 5%. According to the report, the proportion of disability / difficulty among refugees is more prevalent, with 6.8% of Palestinian refugees suffer from disability / difficulty compared to 5.1% among non-refugees. It was found that individuals with disability / difficulty in sight rise among refugees compared to non-refugees, with 3.1% and 2.3% respectively, while the percentage of people with disability / difficulty in movement among refugees was 3.5% compared to 2.5% among non-refugees. The Labor Force Survey of 2017 showed that the participation rate in the labor force was 45.3%, with 45.2% among refugees aged 15 and over residing in Palestine compared to 45.3% among non-refugees and the unemployment rate among refugees is 34.7% compared to 22.8% among non-refugees. One third of the refugees are employed as professionals, technicians, assistants and clerks. These occupations are the most accommodating for refugees, with 32.8% of working refugees compared with 22.4% among non-refugee workers. As for the situation of the Palestinian refugees in the diaspora, a study prepared by FAFO on the living conditions in the Palestinian camps in Jordan in 2011 indicated that 39.9% of the camp population is under the age of 15 years and the average size of the family in the camps was 5.1, and the illiteracy rate among individuals aged 15 and over was 8.6%. The results of the general census of Palestinian refugees in the Palestinian camps and gatherings in Lebanon for 2017 show that they are based in the Sidon region at 35.8%, then in the North by 25.1%, in Tire 14.7% and in Beirut 13.4% Chouf 7.1% and then the Beqaa region by 4%. The results indicated that about 4.9% of Palestinian refugees have non-Palestinian nationality.

 Jordan
 Refugees putting stress on Jordan
Scott Williamson, July 20, 2018, Jordan shut out 60,000 Syrian refugees - and then saw a backlash. This is why, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/20/when-jordan-closed-its-border-to-refugees-the- public-protested-heres-why/
Jordanian officials feel strongly that their country has borne a heavy burden to help Syrian refugees, without adequate assistance from the international community. The government-affiliated Jordan Times recently captured that mood in an op-ed piece that said, "No one can blame Jordan for closing its borders to refugees after having welcomed and hosted hundreds of thousands of them over the past years . . . with little or no help and support from the international community." The Syrian refugee crisis has been a challenge for Jordan, which hosts more than 650,000 registered Syrian refugees. These refugees constitute approximately 7 percent of Jordan's population, a far higher percentage than any country in the West, where the political backlash against refugees has often been severe. While Jordan has received billions of dollars in financial assistance from international donors to cope with this challenge, the government maintains that this aid has covered only a fraction of the costs, and the aid has not helped the country overcome a number of persistent economic challenges.
And children in refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey face hunger and an inability to obtain a proper education.
Reuters, August 2, 2016, Spectre of hunger keeps Syrian children out of school, http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-education-idUSKCN10D2IZ DOA: 8-8-16
With just 60 days to go before the start of the new school year, hundreds of thousands of Syrian parents are faced with the stark choice of whether to feed their children or send them to school, experts said on Wednesday. Nearly 1 million Syrian refugee children are out of school in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan which host the vast majority of the nearly 5 million refugees created by Syria's civil war. Many Syrian children are forced to work to help make ends meet, or unable to pay for transport to school, according to a report written by the head of the London-based think tank, Overseas Development Institute (ODI).

 Religious Asylum
Many religious groups are vulnerable to genocide absent a safe haven that will protect them when they flee.
Lauretta Brown, April 21, 2016, CNS News, Refugees Vulnerable to Genocide the Highest Priority,
http://cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/uscirf-chair-congress-us-should-give-refugees-who-are- vulnerable
Robert P. George, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), told a congressional commission on Tuesday that the United States should give the highest priority to refugees “who are vulnerable to genocide, enslavement, murder, torture. The U.S. government has declared that Christians and other religious minorities in Syria are being targeted for genocide by the Islamic State He also emphasized that “in taking these refugees, prioritization needs to be done on the basis of vulnerability. “The most vulnerable need to be given the highest priority, particularly those who are vulnerable to genocide, enslavement, murder, torture,” George said. George added that sufficient resources need to be allocated to the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies that do security vetting for refugees considered for resettlement “to allow them to expeditiously process applications and thoroughly conduct the background checks in order to facilitate resettlement without compromising U.S. national security.” “The public’s not going to support this if they believe our national security’s being put in jeopardy,” George emphasized. “It’s not that they’re cruel. It’s not that they lack compassion. They have legitimate concerns about security. We believe those concerns can be met, and we think we can make the process more expeditious if we make sure that the funding is there for the security checks to be done in a comprehensive and effective way.” Knights of Columbus CEO Carl Anderson also testified before the Commission on Tuesday, echoing some of George’s recommendations. The Knights of Columbus gave a report documenting eyewitness accounts of the targeting of Christians at the hands of ISIS to the State Department just prior to Secretary of State John Kerry’s March finding that ISIS was committing genocide. “Now the United States must act to stop this genocide, to prevent its recurrence, to assure the future of Christians and other genocide victims whether they wish to leave or to remain,” Anderson said. “Genocide survivors who wish to come to the United States must not be put at the back of the line,” he emphasized. Anderson testified that of the 1,366 Syrian refugees admitted to this country in FY 2016, “fewer than three percent came from the groups targeted for genocide.” As CNSNews.com reported on April 10, the 1,366 Syrian refugees who had been admitted to the U.S. in fiscal 2016 up to that point included 1,330 Sunni Muslims (97.3 percent of the total) and only 9 Christians (or 0.6 percent of the total). “It is wrong when those who faced genocide are excluded – often on the basis of oversight or bureaucratic procedures,” he emphasized.

 International Law
   There have been refugees since the beginning of time. It is only relatively recently, however, that refugees could claim any type of protection based on international law/legal principles/norms.
There are certain obligations to refugees that are established under international law, which governs relationships between sovereign states, international organizations, and private organizations. It establishes obligations and responsibilities among the parties.
The most generally applicable international legal convention is the Convention is the Refugee Convention, which was amended in 1957 to protect all refugees.
  Dieter Kugelmann, lawyer and professor, March 2010, Refugees, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law,http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690- e866 DOA: 9-25-15
In the history of mankind, there have always been people fleeing their habitual place of residence and seeking refuge elsewhere. However, it was only in the 20th century that refugees became an issue on the international level. Before World War I, refugees were treated in accordance with national laws concerning aliens. There were no rules of customary international law taking into account the specific situation of refugees; nor did any bilateral or multilateral agreement exist to regulate their status. As a consequence of the peace treaties after World War I, huge numbers of people had to seek refuge in foreign countries. The League of Nations had to cope not only with the protection of minorities within States but also with complicated refugee problems across borders. Initially, the Assembly of the League of Nations and the States in general thought that the refugee problem would be a temporary phenomenon. But within a short period of time, the problem turned out to be serious and of lasting character. In 1928 the first international instrument with relevance to the legal status of refugees was developed within the League of Nations, the Arrangement relating to the Legal Status of Russian and Armenian Refugees. It was followed by the first legally binding treaty, the 1933 Convention relating to the International Status of Refugees, which was limited in its application to the then existing refugees. As a model instrument, it dealt not only with the issue of travel documents (see also Passports) but with a variety of matters affecting the daily lives of refugees such as personal status, employment, social rights, education, exemption from reciprocity, and expulsion. Based on preparatory work under the auspices of the United Nations, especially within the Economic and Social Council (‘ECOSOC’) (United Nations, Economic and Social Council [ECOSOC]), the Refugee Convention was adopted on 28 July 1951 as a fundamental legal instrument of refugee law. As the application of the Refugee Convention was limited to the refugee problems known at the time of its adoption, its terms were later made applicable to all new refugee situations by the 1967 Refugee Protocol. There are also a number of regional conventions that provide protections, including Africa’s SARPA and The Cartagena Declaration on Refugees (Latin America) the establish legal obligations to refugees living in those areas. And there are a number of different types (or “disciplines”) of international law apply in the instance of responding to humanitarian needs — International Humanitarian Law, International Criminal Law, International Refugee Law, International Human Rights Law, International Disaster Response Laws.

 International Humanitarian Law (IHL) supports action to alleviate immediate suffering.
  Max Cherem, September 29, 2015, assistant professor of philosophy, has been appointed as the Marlene Crandell Francis Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Journal of Political Philosophy, Refugee Rights: Against Expanding the Definition of a “Refugee” and Unilateral Protection Elsewhere, p. 1-23 DOI: 10.1111/jopp.12071
Focusing on non-refoulement. While often conflated, humanitarianism and human rights are different. Each arose out of separate historical trajectories, bodies of law, and representative institutions. Each has different goals and notions of impartiality. International humanitarian law began to arise in 1864 to codify answers to jus in bello debates on noncombatant protection and acceptable means of war. It addresses urgent needs amidst war regardless of their source or a person’s side, and tries to lessen needless suffering. The main group associated with humanitarian law, the International Committee of the Red Cross, sets aside culpability and condemnation so as to better access and serve needy victims.8The thought is that “one cannot be at the same time a champion of justice and charity. One must choose ... the CRC has long since chosen to be a defender of charity.” In contrast, contemporary human rights law emerged after World War II with the 1948 United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent conventions. It is traditionally concerned with individual rights against abuses of state power in both war and peacetime, and with the lower limits of state duties towards constituents and outsiders.10Human rights involve judgments within and across societies, calls to action or reform, and verdicts of accountability. Human rights advocacy groups like Amnesty International pioneered “naming and shaming,” which foregrounds the culpability of rights-violators and identifies parties responsible for remedy. Although human rights set minimal thresholds, they often require radical transformations. In contrast to humanitarian pragmatism, human rights are aspirational: they condemn and praise to induce reform or prevent harm instead of seeking to define and mitigate unnecessary suffering.

 Both IHL and IHRL apply when refugees are fleeing conflict
 Huma Haider, International Development Research Fellow, March 2013, International Legal Frameworks for Humanitarian Action: Topic Guide,http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/International%20Legal%20Frameworks%20for%20H umanitarian%20Action.pdf DOA: 10-2-15
Refugees caught up in armed conflict are protected under both IHL and international refugee law. Article 5 of the Refugee Convention allows for the concurrent application of the Convention and other instruments granting rights and benefits to refugees. IHL and refugee law can also apply successively. The existence of an armed conflict is not in itself sufficient criteria to qualify someone as a refugee under the Convention. Where a victim of armed conflict is forced to leave his or her country due to violations of IHL (or IHRL), however, such violations can form part of the refugee definition and become a key factor in triggering refugee
protection (Jaquemet, 2001). This may be more likely where armed conflicts have an ethnic or religious dimension, as it could trigger the condition of fleeing because of fear of persecution (ICRC, 2005a). In situations where armed elements are engaging in severe violations of IHL, this could be sufficient to accept that all civilians belonging to or associated with the ‘enemy’ side will have a well-founded fear of persecution, without having to engage in individual determinations (Jaquemet, 2001).

 IHL establishes obligations to meet the needs of refugees.
 Huma Haider, International Development Research Fellow, March 2013, International Legal Frameworks for Humanitarian Action: Topic Guide,http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/International%20Legal%20Frameworks%20for%20H umanitarian%20Action.pdf DOA: 10-2-15
Prevention of displacement and protection of refugees under IHL
 • _Prohibition of forced displacement: Parties to a conflict are expressly prohibited from forcibly moving civilians, whether in cases of occupation (GCIV, Art 49) or non-international armed conflicts (APII, Art 17). There is an exemption under exceptional circumstances (where the security of the civilian population involved or imperative military reasons so demand). Violations of these provisions are war crimes under international criminal law (ICC Statute, Art 8).
• _Protection from the effects of hostilities in order to prevent displacement: The prohibitions against targeting civilians and civilian property/objects, as well as duties to take precautions to spare the civilian population, are also aimed at preventing displacement (ICRC, 2005a).
• _Protection during displacement: IHL provisions that seek to protect displaced and legally evacuated civilians include the need to ensure that any necessary evacuations are carried out under satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition; and that the displaced have appropriate accommodation and that families are not separated. Refugees also benefit from protections afforded to aliens in the territory of a party to a conflict under the GCIV (ICRC, 2005a)
 Article 9 of the 1951 Convention allows for derogation from treaty provisions in times of war. Unlike international human rights law, the Convention does not provide for certain non-derogable rights. IHL can therefore be a particularly important safeguard in such situations.

 IHL applies to all governments
 Huma Haider, International Development Research Fellow, March 2013, International Legal Frameworks for Humanitarian Action: Topic Guide,http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/International%20Legal%20Frameworks%20for%20H umanitarian%20Action.pdf DOA: 10-2-15
The absence of effective national protection results in the need for international protection. International refugee law applies to states that are party to the relevant treaties and to all states under customary law. Internally displaced persons, who remain within the borders of their own country, are subject to national law and applicable international law such as IHL and IHRL. IHL and IHRL are incorporated in binding regional instruments as applicable and as reflected in the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement(1998). While not part of binding treaty law, the Guiding Principles establish standards for the protection of IDPs. It can be challenging, however, to encourage states to comply with non-binding frameworks. In recent years, there have been significant developments in elaborating binding legislative frameworks – _including, for example, the codification of the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of IDPs in Africa, and the Great Lakes Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to IDPs.

Nevertheless, within the context of the international refugee regime, which brings together states, UNHCR, and other international organizations, the UNHCR Executive Committee, and non-governmental organizations, among others, the 1951 Convention continues to play an important part in the protection of refugees, in the promotion and provision of solutions for refugees, in ensuring the security and related interests of states, sharing responsibility, and generally promoting human rights. Ministerial Meetings of States Parties, convened in Geneva by the government of Switzerland to mark the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the Convention in December 2001 and December 2011, expressly acknowledged, ‘the continuing relevance and resilience of this international regime of rights and principles...’ and reaffirmed that the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol ‘are the foundation of the international refugee protection regime and have enduring value and relevance in the twenty-first century’.25 In many states, judicial and administrative procedures for the determination of refugee status have established the necessary legal link between refugee status and protection, contributed to a broader and deeper understanding of key elements in the Convention refugee definition, and helped to consolidate the fundamental principle of non-refoulement. While initially concluded as an agreement between states on the treatment of refugees, the 1951 Convention has inspired both doctrine and practice in which the language of refugee rights is entirely appropriate. The concept of the refugee as an individual with a well-founded fear of persecution continues to carry weight, and to symbolize one of the essential, if not exclusive, reasons for flight. The scope and extent of the refugee definition, however, have matured under the influence of human rights law and practice, to the point that, in certain well-defined circumstances, the necessity for protection against the risk of harm can trigger an obligation to protect.
          Understanding international law, the various types, and how those apply to the treatment of refugees takes a bit of work, but hopefully I have at least laid out the basics here in a way that will increase your understanding.
Countries that have signed on to these treaties (which includes most nations) have legal obligations to provide, at a minimum, safe havens for refugees.

 Human Rights
  93

 Refugees suffer many violations of their human rights.
Ann Lise Purkey, Faculty of Law, McGill University, Montreal, 2014, Journal of Refugee Studies Vol. 27, No. 2, A Dignified Approach: Legal Empowerment and Justice for Human Rights Violations in Protracted Refugee Situations, p. 260-1
Although it is well accepted that the law and legal institutions and mechanisms can play an important role in ensuring that every individual within a society is able to live a dignified life in which their rights are fully realized, this knowledge has had little impact on the way in which states and the international community at large address the situation of one of the world’s most vulnerable groups of people: individuals caught in protracted refugee situations. In many ways, protracted refugee situations are a form of social, political, legal and even economic purgatory for those trapped within them. These refugees often share many of the characteristics of other marginalized and vulnerable groups including poverty, discrimination, lack of access to services, social exclusion, and routine and systemic human rights violations, but face the added challenge of lacking an effective citizenship and/or formal legal status in the country in which they are living. The great number of refugees caught in increasingly prolonged states of ‘rightlessness’ presents a fundamental challenge to the international human rights regime and demands a reimagining of responses to these situations, The rightlessness of refugees is not a given; the rights of refugees are protected under international human rights law, the 1951 Refugee Convention, regional human rights treaties and often domestic human rights law. The problem arises with the implementation and enforcement of these rights. In practice, refugees in protracted situations rarely benefit from anything near the full range of rights to which they are legally entitled. In these situations, the rights actually enjoyed by refugees are contingent upon a broad range of political and economic factors including the level of international assistance provided and the perceived potential outcome of the refugee crisis (Goodwin- Gill and McAdam 2007). Host states often lack the necessary resources and have little political incentive to guarantee a broad range of rights to refugees. Thus, instead of being regarded as individuals in need of protection or as potential assets to the state, refugee communities are more often viewed as burdens and sources of insecurity to be contained and minimized (Loescher and Milner 2004). The dignity and human rights of refugees are made subordinate to the entrenched interests of the host state, other states, humanitarian actors and donors.

 Individuals have a human right to seek protection from physical violence
Jacqueline Bhabha, Jr. Lecturer in Law at Harvard Law School, director of Harvard’s University Committee on Human Rights Studies, 2009, Human Rights Quarterly, “Arendt’s Children: Do Today’s Migrant Children Have a Right to Have Rights?” Project Muse. http://muse.jhu.edu/search/results?action=search&searchtype=author&section1=author&search1=%22Bhabha%2 C%20Jacqueline.%22.
Access to basic shelter, subsistence level welfare payments, and in-kind benefits is as fundamental to modern conceptions of rights in general, and children’s rights in particular, as is protection from physical violence. The same is true for access to such social and economic rights as education and health care, as the Committee on the Rights of the Child has frequently noted in its concluding observations on states parties’ periodic reports. Yet here too, public officials operate under personal codes of conduct that translate into dramatic rights denials. Sylvia da Lomba has remarked, “Curtailments of social rights for irregular migrants in host countries have become essential components of restrictive immigration policies. . . . The threat of destitution as a deterrent against irregular migration generates acute tensions within host states between immigration laws and human rights protections.” 39 Consider this Spanish case: Sixteen-year-old ‘Abd al Samad R. has been in Ceuta [an autonomous Spanish city located on the Moroccan coast] for about five years, including two and a half years living at the San Antonio Center. While at San Antonio he was diagnosed as suffering from renal disease, a potentially life-threatening medical condition, and he received medical treatment. Then, in October 2001 he was told to leave San Antonio, apparently for disciplinary infractions. When we interviewed ‘Abd al Samad on November 8, 2001, he was living with a group of other children and youth in makeshift hovels squeezed between a breakwater and piles of ceramic tiles and other building supplies. He had received no medical treatment since leaving San Antonio, although he was frequently in severe pain. “The pain comes often, when it is cold, or when someone hits me,” he said. “I tried to go to the hospital when I was in pain but they wouldn’t admit me. They won’t accept you at the hospital unless some one from San Antonio comes with you. When the pain comes I can’t move so who will come to take me to the hospital?” Without official confirmation of the child’s social entitlements, he remained outside the categories established by the state—in effect not a person before the law. These exclusionary attitudes were translated directly into rightlessness. The acute risks to which this willful exclusion, combined with the fear of detection as an irregular migrant by state officials, can give rise were noted by the European Court of Human Rights in the case
of Siliadin v. France. In this case, an unaccompanied child from Togo, “unlawfully present in [France] and in fear of arrest by the police . . . was . . . subjected to forced labour . . . [and] held in servitude,” compelled to carry out housework and child care for fifteen hours a day without holidays. 41 The Court commented that the applicant “was entirely at [her employers’] mercy, since her papers had been confiscated . . . [S]he had no freedom of movement or free time. As she had not been sent
to school . . . the appli-cant could not hope that her situation would improve.” 42 Irregular migration status increases the risk of invisibility and thus gross rights violations. As the Court pointed out, states parties must recognize this serious risk and act “with greater firmness . . . in assessing the infringements of the fundamental values of democratic societies.” In other words, according to the Court, states have an obligation to “see” Arendt’s children—willful and selective blindness is not a legitimate option .

 Refugee human rights are protected under several Conventions.
Dieter Kugelmann, lawyer and professor, March 2010, Refugees, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690- e866 DOA: 9-25-15
Sources of Human Rights for Refugees
38 There are relevant provisions on refugees in human rights instruments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates some habeas corpus rights which are applicable without discrimination (Art. 9 UDHR), the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution (Art. 14 UDHR), the right to a nationality (Art. 15 UDHR), and the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State (Art. 13 UDHR; Movement, Freedom of, International Protection). The latter right is also provided for in Art. 12 ICCPR. The two Covenants are based on the non-discriminatory character of human rights. According to Art. 2 (1) ICCPR, each State Party must ensure the rights in the ICCPR to ‘all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction’. Referring to this provision, the Human Rights Committee has adopted General Comment No 15: The Positions of Aliens under the Covenant ([9 April 1986] GAOR 41st Session Supp 40, 117), in which it holds that the ICCPR does not recognize the right of aliens to enter or reside in the territory of a State Party. Yet it also states that in certain circumstances the ICCPR may afford protection to an alien ‘even in relation to entry or residence, for example, when considerations of non-discrimination, prohibition of inhuman treatment and respect for family life arise’ (No 5 General Comment No 15).
39 The protection of children seeking refuge is guaranteed by Art. 22 Convention on the Rights of the Child (‘CROC’ [adopted 20 November 1989, entered into force 2 September 1990] 1577 UNTS 3). The duty of States to protect the family unity of refugees is in general affirmed by State practice, and the necessary opinio iuris can be derived from legal material. The obligation of States to protect the family is laid down in Art. 23 ICCPR and relating to family unification in Art. 10 CROC. The obligations of States do not necessarily result in an individual right of a family member.
40 The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) holds the view that States have the right to control the entry, residence, and expulsion of aliens (Vilvarajah v the United Kingdom [ECtHR] Series A No 215 at 34 para. 102). There is no right to political asylum in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950) (‘ECHR’) or its Protocols. Nevertheless, the ECtHR holds that the rights safeguarded by the ECHR can provide for a legal position of aliens implying far-reaching State obligations towards refugees.
41 Within the scope of Art. 3 ECHR, the ECtHR has strengthened the protection of aliens from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (eg Chahal v UK [ECtHR] Reports 1996-V 1831 at 21 para. 74); see also Human Dignity, International Protection). It is well established in the case-law of the ECtHR that expulsion or any other kind of removal by a State Party may engage the responsibility of that State. If substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if expelled, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Art. 3 ECHR in the receiving country, Art. 3 ECHR implies the obligation not to expel the person in question to that country (see Soering Case [ECtHR] Series A No 161 at 35 paras 90–
91; Cruz Varas v Sweden [ECtHR] Series A No 201 at 28 paras 69–70). In favour of third-country nationals, the right to family life guaranteed in Art. 8 ECHR can—on exceptional conditions—encompass the right to remain in a country (Dalia v France [ECtHR] Reports 1998-I 76 at 91 para. 52; Boultif v Switzerland [ECtHR] Reports 2001-IX 119 at 130 para. 46). For specific situations, the ECtHR holds that the right to family life provides for the right to legalize the stay by granting a formal residence permit or a similar document (Sisojeva v Latvia [ECtHR]
         96

 App 60654/00 paras 104–107; in this case, the Grand Chamber struck the application in its judgment of 15 January 2007; in Rodrigues da Silva v Netherlands [ECtHR] Reports 2006-I 223, the Grand Chamber rejected the application on 3 July 2006).

 There is an obligation to protect the human rights of the stateless, as their rights will not otherwise be protected
Seyla Benhabib, professor of political science and philosophy at Yale, June 2004, “The Rights of Others.” http://books.google.com/books?id=3cuUHAJNmuYC&dq=Seyla+Benhabib+“Rights+of+Others”&printsec=front cover&source=bl&ots=d-pqxd2bJq&sig=Oyb7-wKlE-

After Kant, it was Hannah Arendt who turned to the ambiguous legacy of cosmopolitan law, and who dissected the paradoxes at the heart of the terminally based sovereign state system. One of the great political thinkers of the twentieth century, Hannah Arendt argued that the twin phenomena of "political evil" and “statelessness” would remain the most daunting problems into the twenty-first century as well (Arendt 1349.;,134; [1951]1968;seeBenhabib[1996] 21103). Arendt always insisted that among the root causes of totalitarianism was the collapse of the nation—state system in Europe during the two world wars. The totalitarian disregard for human life and the eventual treatment of human beings as "superfluous" entities began, for Hannah Arendt, when millions of human beings were rendered “stateless" and denied the "right to have rights." Statelessness, or the loss of nationality status, she argued, was tantamount to the loss of all rights. The stateless were deprived not only of their citizenship rights; they were deprived of any human rights. The rights of man and the rights of the citizen, which the modem bourgeois revolutions had so clearly delineated were deeply imbricated. The loss of citizenship rights, therefore, contrary to all human rights declarations, was politically tantamount to the loss of human rights altogether. This chapter begins with an examination of Arendt contribution; thereafter, l develop a series of systematic considerations which are aimed to show why neither the right to naturalization nor the prerogative of denaturalization can be considered sovereign privileges alone; the airs: is a universal human right, while the second - denaturalization · is its abrogation.

 The Right to asylum is protected by international human rights law
Maria-Teresa, Gil BazoSenior Lecturer in Law, Newcastle Law School (Newcastle University), International Journal of Refugee Law, 2015, Vol. 27, No. 1, 3–28, Asylum as a General Principal of International Law, p. 5
These instances show that the question of asylum is very much alive and that the debate as to its nature and content remains controversial. The purpose of this article is to explore the nature of asylum as a general principle of international law. The analysis that follows is informed by the understanding that ‘[t]he development of the law on asylum is inextricably bound up with the general development towards the greater recognition and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual by international law’, including the right to asylum as a human right. The analysis in this article is also grounded in international law itself. In this regard, it is worth noting that, while in common law judicial decisions constitute primary sources of law, in international law they are secondary sources and enjoy the same status as the views ‘of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations’ (article 38(d) of the Statute of International Court of Justice (ICJ), emphasis added). Article 59 of the ICJ Statute further affirms that ‘[t]he decision of the Court has no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case’. Judicial decisions will be considered in this article, as appropriate, insofar as they constitute an expression of state practice, or if they reflect the authentic interpretation of treaties by international courts or human rights monitoring bodies, but not as primary sources of law or authority of higher rank than the most qualified doctrine.

 Protecting human rights protects several important interests
Allen Buchanan, political philosopher at Duke, 2004 Justice, Legitimacy, and Self-Determination: Moral Foundations for International Law, Kindle Edition, page/location number at end of card
Consider first the right not to be tortured. As I have already observed, securing this right protects several important interests, thereby contributing significantly to individual well-being. First, and most obviously, there is the interest in avoiding pain, suffering, and terror. Second, there is the interest in avoiding the gross indignity of being a mere object, completely at the mercy of another who acknowledges no constraints on how he treats one. (Whether we consider this indignity merely as detracting from well-being or as being incompatible with recognizing the autonomy of persons understood as a value independent of well-being, it supplies an important reason for regarding the right not to be tortured as a human right.) Third, the effects of torture, both physical and psychological, chare often debilitating, robbing the victim of the capacity for pursuits and enjoyments that would contribute to her well-being, being, including the capacity for intimacy and healthy family relations." " Fourth, so far as torture has a point (as opposed to being an exercise in pure sadism), being tortured or being under the threat of being tortured makes one vulnerable to betraying one's principles, one's associates, or both. Fifth, where institutions do not secure the right against being tortured, individuals may fear that they will fall victim to it and this sense of vulnerability itself reduces well-being and constrains choices. For all of these rather obvious reasons, there is a strong case for the assertion that the right not to be tortured is a basic human right. Allen Buchanan.

 Morality
  101

 There is a moral obligation to help refugees who are impoverished and dying.
Daniel Altman, 9-8-15, Foreign Policy, We Should Be Competing to Take in
Refugees, http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/08/we-should-all-be-competing-to-take-in-refugees-europe-
syria/ DOA: 9-22-15 Daniel Altman is senior editor, economics at Foreign Policy and is an adjunct professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.
Refugees are spending thousands of euros to make treacherous journeys over land and sea. As the world has lately been reminded (but too infrequently for my taste), many die along the way. This is an economic problem as well as a moral one. An impoverished refugee will have a harder time making a fresh start, and a dead refugee never gets the chance. That’s why it makes sense for Germany and other host countries to pay for refugees’ safe transit; they’ll have to shell out less to support refugees upon arrival, and they’ll likely have more successful refugees paying taxes in the future.

 These refugees have no choice but to flee.
Michael Ignatieff is a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, September 5, 2015, New York Times, The refugee crisis isn’t a ‘European Problem,” http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/the-refugee- crisis-isnt-a-european-problem.html?_r=0 DOA: 9-22-15
The Vietnamese and Hungarians were fleeing Communism. What’s holding back sympathy for the Syrians? They’ve been barrel-bombed in Aleppo by their own regime, they’ve been tortured, kidnapped and massacred by miscellaneous jihadis and opposition militias. They’ve been in refugee camps for years, waiting for that cruelly deceiving fiction “the international community” to come to their aid. Now, when they take to the roads, to the boats and to the trains, all our political leaders can think of is fences, barbed wire and more police. What must Syrians, camped on the street outside the Budapest railway station, be thinking of all that fine rhetoric of ours about human rights and refugee protection? If we fail, once again, to show that we mean what we say, we will be creating a generation with abiding hatred in its heart. So if compassion won’t do it, maybe prudence and fear might. God help us if these Syrians do not forgive us our indifference.

 Refugees cannot survive in refugee camps due to a lack of support.
EU Observor, September 25, 2015, Six EU States Slash Food Aid for Syrian Refugees, https://euobserver.com/migration/130400 DOA: 9-25-15
Every member state, except the Netherlands, has slashed contributions to the World Food Progamme (WFP) in 2015. EU leaders at an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday (23 September) are being asked to shore up contributions. The drastic cuts over the past year mean the UN agency has been unable to hand out food vouchers to hundreds of thousands of Syrians at refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and Turkey. The lack of food and deplorable conditions at the camps is, in part, compelling many to take the journey to the EU. At the camp in Jordan, some 229,000 Syrians stopped receiving food aid in September. In Turkey, around 60,000 women gave birth in the camps since the start of the conflict. WFP has since had to halve assistance to almost 1.3 million Syrian refugees in the region. Most live off $0.50 a day. The agency is warning
that disruptions to water supplies could provoke major outbreaks of disease. “Faced with such harsh conditions who can blame people for seeking a safe haven in Europe”, said European parliament president Martin Schulz. Austria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, and Slovakia made the most drastic cuts. All sliced their contributions by 100 percent this year, compared to last year. Sweden’s contribution dropped by 95 percent, followed by Lithuania at 69.5 percent, and Belgium at 54.7 percent. The UK also dropped by 29.5 percent. Others like Croatia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania gave nothing in the past two years.

 The Golden Rule.
Arizona Central, September 24, 2015, Pope Francis Urges Congress to Show Compassion for
Immigrants, http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2015/09/24/pope-francis-urges-congress- show-compassion-immigrants/72734356/ DOA: 9-25-15
Pope Francis delivered lawmakers a message of compassion and understanding for immigrants Thursday as part of his historic, nearly hour-long speech to joint session of Congress, a bitterly divided body that has grappled with border-security and immigration-reform issues for a decade. In doing so, the pope appealed to the United States' time-honored reputation as a nation of immigrants. "We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were at once foreigners," said Pope Francis, the first-ever leader of the Roman Catholic Church to address U.S. senators and representatives. "I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descendants of immigrants." Citing the global refugee crisis as well as immigration to the United States from Mexico and Central America, the pope, who was often interrupted by
applause, reminded lawmakers of the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you." He also told the joint session on Capitol Hill that immigrants are looking for a better life for themselves and their loved ones, which is the same that anyone would want for their children. "We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation," the pope said. "To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays, to discard whatever proves troublesome." The Golden Rule guides in "a clear direction," he said. "Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated," Pope Francis said. "Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. "In a word, if we want security, let us give security," he continued. "If we want life, let us give life. If we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities."
A second moral foundation is empathy. We should have empathy for the refugees and be moved to provide assistance.

On Sunday, I accompanied the employment minister, Ylva Johansson, to a rally organized by the youth movements of the Social Democrats, the Greens, and other progressive parties. The featured speaker was the prime minister himself. As thousands braved a nasty rainstorm to attend the outdoor rally, Löfven declared, "We need to decide right now what kind of Europe we are going to be. My Europe takes in refugees. My Europe doesn't build walls," he said. Johansson added, in our conversation, "In Sweden we are different and we need to stay different. To feel empathy with the suffering of another person, a person who is not like ourselves, is part of being human. To solve this refugee crisis is not rocket science, it is not impossible."
A third foundation relates to the fact that many countries in the world are responsible for the violence, either failing to stop it or by causing it.

 But if those praising Merkel’s “brave” stance were honest, they would acknowledge that she isn’t offering any long-term solutions either. Even if Europe does take another couple of hundred thousand people, dividing them up between countries—as it should—won’t prevent others from coming. To avoid accusations of heartlessness, the Italian coast guard rescues thousands of people from tiny boats and rubber dinghies. As a result, people keep taking the terrible risk. Here is what no one wants to say: This is, in essence, a security crisis. For years now, Europeans have chosen to pretend that wars taking place in Syria and Libya were somebody else’s problem. It’s also a foreign policy crisis: At different times and for different reasons, all of the large European states—the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany—have blocked attempts to create a common foreign and defense policy, and as a result they have no diplomatic or political clout. They haven’t wanted European leadership, and most of them wouldn’t have wanted American leadership either, even if any had been on offer. The richest economy in the world has a power vacuum at its heart and no army. Now the consequences are literally washing up on Europe’s shores.
And the US invasion of Iraq is a significant cause of the current problem.

And here’s the second simple truth. While we can argue forever about the causes of conflict in the Middle East, it is impossible to ignore the impact of American foreign policy on what’s happening in Europe. It was shocking to see an “expert” from the Council on Foreign Relations quoted on Saturday saying that the situation is “largely Europe’s responsibility.” How, exactly? The Iraq invasion (which could reasonably be described as “largely America’s responsibility”) unleashed a period of instability and competition in the region that is collapsing states and fueling sectarian conflict.
Fourth, there is a strong obligation to protect refugee children because they are uniquely vulnerable.
Julianne Duncan, Ph.D. Director, Office of Children's Services Migration and Refugee Services/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Joint Testimony of Migration and Refugee Services/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service before The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration February 28, 2002. http://www.usccb.org/mrs/duncantestimony.shtml
Because of our long experience in caring for and advocating on behalf of unaccompanied minors, Mr. Chairman, our testimony today will point out changes in law we believe are required, as laid out in Senator Feinstein's bill, to reform the current system. In the view of MRS/USCCB and LIRS, our government's treatment of unaccompanied alien children should be governed by the following principles: The Federal government has a special responsibility to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are treated with dignity and care. Children are our most precious gifts. Their youthfulness, lack of maturity, and inexperience make them inherently vulnerable and in the need of the protection of adults. Unaccompanied alien children are among the most vulnerable of this vulnerable population. They are separated from both their families and their communities of origin, they are often escaping persecution and exploitation, they often find themselves in a land in which the language and culture are alien to them, and they are thrust into complex legal proceedings that even adults have great difficulty navigating and understanding. Unaccompanied minors should be held in the least restrictive setting as possible, preferably with family members or with a foster family. Secure facilities should be used on a very limited basis and only when absolutely necessary to protect a child's immediate safety or the safety of the community.   Minors should be reunited with parents, guardians, or other family members within the United States as soon as possible. While a family
is in temporary detention, they should not be separated unless it is in the best interest of the child. Because of their
                          106
 
 special vulnerability and inability to represent themselves, unaccompanied children should be provided with legal representation and guardians ad litem to assist them in immigration proceedings and to see that care and placement decisions are made with a child's best interest in mind. Mr. Chairman, these principles are not currently governing U.S. policy toward unaccompanied alien children in the United States. Instead, thousands of children each year are held in detention, some with juvenile criminal offenders, with little or no access to legal assistance and with decreasing ability to reunite with family members.
Fifth, we should be hospitable and welcome others in need -- embracing is a means to overcome our own racism and fear of the other.
Karima Laachir, lecturer in cultural theory at university of Birmingham, Mobilizing Hospitality, 2007, p. 177-8
The European popular imagination has been haunted by images of Europe inundated by foreigners — economic and political refugees — perceived as 'we scroungers', job-snatchers' and 'threats to security'.' Some
politicians started to foment these fears to pick up extra votes, especially extreme right- movements, which have been gaining ground in local and parliamentary elect The increasing popularity of leaders of far right parties, who all publicly voice xenophobia and racism against those perceived as foreigners, are alarming examples of the return of exclusionist popular nationalism and fascism to haunt postcolonial Europe. 'Immigration' demands and those of ethnic minorities, especially religious demands, have become contentious issues in Europe. Hospitality has become more difficult since the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent 'war on terror' led by the American Government. The terrorist bombings in Madrid (March 2004) and London (July 2005) have been interpreted by some as a conflict between contending civilizations, Western and Islamic. The lives of diasporic Muslims and of immigrants in Europe and the United States have become subject to constant surveillance and are the subject of various regulations that aim to keep Muslim Fundamentalist networks under control. However, the lives of ordinary European Muslims have been deeply affected by these changes and, as a result, their loyalty, together with their European citizenship and strong cultural affiliation to Europe as their homeland, have been brought into question. They are now viewed with distrust and caution. Hospitality is important, therefore, as an analytical concept since it opens up the debates of welcoming 'otherness' beyond issues of the reception of immigrants by their 'host' countries, towards more important problems of living together with people of 'different' cultural, religious and social affiliations. More than ever before, the world is a melting pot of different cultures and thus we are confronted with the theme of how to survive with the 'other', or those perceived as others, without seeing them as a threat or danger. The problem of xenophobia and racism (which is not limited to Europe) in the last decades after the horrors of colonialism and fascism raises a crucial question about the relationships between communities of different `race', religion and culture. The `us' and 'them' differentiation — camouflaged in various discourses: 'ethnic' (a soft word for `racial'), 'religious', but mainly cultural terms — is marked by a strong degree of xenophobia, fear and racism. Technological and communicative revolutions, economic and political upheavals, such as deindustrialization, unemployment, poverty and the mass displacement of populations are all factors that have 'once again invited many to find in populist ultranationalism. racism, and authoritarianism, reassurance and a variety of certainty that can answer radical doubts and anxieties over self-hood, being, and belonging' (Gilroy, 2000: 155).
The primary ethical responsibility is to support the other – the person we do not know.
Leonard Grob, Professor of Philosophy at Farleigh Dickinson University, 99, Ethics After the Holocaust, p. 8-11
This face-to-face encounter is thus no cognitive event. As we have seen, I cannot know the Other as Other without diminishing his or her otherness. I can, however, encounter that Other in what Levinas terms an
ethical event. Indeed, it is only with the rending of the ontological schema that ethics first becomes
possible. Prior to my meeting with the Other, there is no ethics as such. Within the totality of being, I am limited
              107
 
 in my egoist ambition only by a lack of power. The Other who meets me face-to-face challenges my very right to exercise power. In so doing, ethics is born. Cognition no longer represents the highest activity of which a human is capable; it is replaced by "revelation" of the Other as an ethical event in which, for the first time, I come to realize the arbitrariness of my egoist ambitions. The thematizing of the cognitive subject is replaced by nothing short of an act of witness on the part of a being who now becomes an ethical subject. The Other who contests me is an Other truly independent of my appropriative powers and thus one to whom I can have, for the first time, ethical obligations. As Levinas puts it, this Other is the first being whom I can wish to murder. Before the totality is rent by the manifestation of the face, there can be no will to act immorally, as there can be no will to act morally, in any ultimate sense of that word. If one begins with the "imperial I" appropriating its world, ethics as such can never be founded. The other with whom I inter- act is simply a datum, an aspect of my universe. Morality makes its first appearance when I confront the Other who is truly Other. Although the Other appears to me now, on principle, as someone I could wish to kill, he or she in fact summons me to respond with nonviolence: I am called to willingly renounce my power to act immorally. What I hear from the Other, Levinas claims, are the words "Thou shalt not kill." Harkening to this injunction constitutes my inaugural act as an ethical being. In Levinas's words, "Morality begins when freedom, instead of being justified by itself, feels itself to be arbitrary and violent." Addressing the face of the Other I become ethical. In a turnabout from what has been the norm in the history of Western thought, ethics now is seen, by Levinas, to constitute the essence of philosophy. Ethics is now "first philosophy," a position usurped until now by the ontological enterprise. The meeting with the Other-who-is-truly-Other is a primordial event: "Since the Other looks at me," Levinas exclaims, "I am responsible for him, without even having taken on responsibilities in his regard " In encountering the Other, I assume responsibility for him. "Responsibility," Levinas proclaims, "is the essential, primary and fundamental structure of subjectivity.... Responsibility in fact is not a simple attribute of subjectivity, as if the latter already existed in itself, before the ethical relationship."'" In other words, my structure as a human being, in any significant sense of that word, is to be responsible to the Other. My personhood is not to be identified with that of the solitary ego appropriating its world; it is rather a personhood fundamentally oriented toward the
Other. Ethics, for Levinas, is thus not to be identified with any ethical or even meta-ethical position. Levinas speaks neither as deontologist nor consequentialist. He does not attempt to articulate any list of rights or obligations, or even the principles on which the latter would be based. All ethical theories, he
implies, are secondary to, or derivative from, a primordial or founding moment: the encounter with
the face of the Other. It is this moment-of-all-moments which institutes the very possibility of the "ethical" systems so hotly debated within the history of Western thought. Before there can be any ethical positioning—before there can be discussions of virtue, happiness, duties—there is the meeting with the Other.
These moral obligations extend even when large numbers of refugees are involved.
Michael Walzer, philosopher, 2008, Spheres Of Justice: A Defense Of Pluralism And Equality, p. 51
The cruelty of this dilemma is mitigated to some degree by the principle of asylum. Any refugee who has actually made his escape, who is not seeking but has found at least a temporary refuge, can claim asylum— a right recognized today, for example, in British law; and then he cannot be deported so long as the only available country to which he might be sent “is one to which he is unwilling to go owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality ... or political opinion.” 20 Though he is a stranger, and newly come, the rule against expulsion applies to him as if he had already made a life where he is: for there is no other place where he can make a life. But this principle was designed for the sake of individuals, considered one by one, where their numbers are so small that they cannot have any significant impact upon the character of the political community. What happens when the numbers are not small? Consider the case of the millions of Russians captured or enslaved by the Nazis in the Second World War and overrun by Allied armies in the final offensives of the war. All these people were returned, many of108
                       
 them forcibly returned, to the Soviet Union, where they were immediately shot or sent on to die in labor camps. 21 Those of them who foresaw their fate pleaded for asylum in the West, but for expediential reasons (having to do with war and diplomacy, not with nationality and the problems of
assimilation), asylum was denied them. Surely, they should not have been forcibly returned— not once it was known that they would be murdered; and that means that the Western allies should have been ready to take them in, negotiating among themselves, I suppose, about appropriate numbers. There was no other choice: at the extreme, the claim of asylum is virtually undeniable.. Walzer, Michael (2008-08-05). Spheres Of Justice: A Defense Of Pluralism And Equality (p. 51). Basic Books.

And even if we don’t think we are responsible for the refugee crisis, we should show solidarity and demonstrate compassion.
Komorowski et al, September 22, 2015, The Guardian, Our duty in Central Europe is to show compassion to refugees, http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/our-duty-in-central-europe-is-to-show-compassion-to- refugees DOA: 9-22-15
But this rift within a united Europe resurfaces today. This time it has a moral dimension. It is true, we are not accountable for the instability and collapse of refugees’ home countries. We are not the ones who have turned them into states plagued by incessant fear, where people are at risk of violent death, and where human life is brutish and short. Unlike the former colonial and imperial powers that took in large numbers of immigrants after the second world war, we have little experience of coexisting with people of different cultures, from far-off lands. Nonetheless, as human beings, we have a duty to show compassion and to provide them with assistance. This is also our duty as Europeans. The European community was founded on the principle of solidarity. Today we must not refuse to take joint responsibility for the union, nor turn a blind eye to human suffering and the situation of countries most affected by the rising tide of migration.

 Prioritization/Weighing
The resolution does not just ask the question of whether there is an obligation to provide refugees with a safe haven but also whether or not that outweighs a state’s right to control its borders.
There are several arguments Con debaters can make in favor of this.
One, the arguments identified above prove there is a moral obligation to provide a safe haven for refugees. Com debaters can argue this moral obligation creates inherently outweighs any competing concern.
Two, obligations under international law establish that those obligations trump concerns related to sovereignty and protection of the border. This is something nations agree to when they ratify treaties.
Three, if we fail to prioritize human rights over the national interest, genocide is possible.
Paul Hoffman is the Chair of the International Executive Committee of Amnesty International. He is a civil rights and human rights lawyer with the Venice-based law firm of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris & Hoffman LLP, Human Rights Quarterly, November 2004, p. 932-955
History shows that when societies trade human rights for security, most often they get neither. Instead, minorities and other marginalized groups pay the price through violation of their human rights. Sometimes this trade-off comes in the form of mass murder or genocide, other times in the form of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, or the suppression of speech or religion. Indeed, millions of lives have been destroyed in the last sixty years when human rights norms have not been observed.'' Undermining the strength of international human rights law and institutions will only facilitate such human rights violations in the future and confound efforts to bring violators to justice.'
Four, in the context of providing a safe haven for refugees, it's not even that large of a resource commitment. This is not something that threatens the nation.
Luke William Hunt, 2014, Human Rights Quarterly, The Global Ethics of Helping and Harming, v. 36(4), pp. 798-819 (Luke William Hunt is on fellowship at the University of Virginia, where he is pursuing a Ph.D. focused on philosophy of law and political philosophy. Prior to beginning his doctoral studies, he completed law school and was a law clerk for Judge James P. Jones, United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He then worked at the US Department of Justice for six years.)
Buchanan’s moral theory of international law is based upon his conception of a natural duty of justice, “according to which each of us—independently of which institutions we find ourselves in or the special
commitments we have undertaken—has a limited moral obligation to help ensure that all persons have access to institutions that protect their basic rights.”12 One of the goals of his project is to determine the extent of a state’s positive duties to other states. While this project would include basic humanitarian aid, like rescue and beneficence, Buchanan assumes there is a human right to subsistence resources and thus focuses on whether and to what extent international law should recognize rights of international distributive justice (social and economic rights, for instance).13 The present focus is on how Buchanan’s theory applies to the weaker positive duty regarding the extent to which a state is required to provide international humanitarian aid in the form of rescue and beneficence. This is an appropriate starting point because rescue and beneficence are arguably less demanding and less controversial duties than distributive justice.
       110
  
 Given that it is a relatively limited resource commitment, it is easier to argue that resources should be invested in creating safe havens within borders.

 Solvency/Advocacy for Reducing Restrictions

 Europe Should Reduce Refugee Restrictions Refugees dying because Europe won’t accept them
The Observor, January 6, 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/observer-view-on-britain- failing-in-moral-duty-to-help-refugees The Observer view on Britain failing dismally in its moral duty to help refugees
There are also massive failings across Europe. How things have shifted since 2015, when Angela Merkel flung open Germany’s doors to refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq for six months, declaring “Wir schaffen das” – “we can do this”. No other country followed: the rest of Europe simply free rode on Germany’s openness. The approach has evolved from one of saving lives in the Mediterranean to stopping people from making the crossing altogether. The death rate for people attempting the crossing has risen dramatically from one in 42 to one in 18 in just a year, even as the numbers crossing have fallen. And as the result of unsavoury pacts with countries with terrible human rights records themselves – Turkey, and even Libya – the price Europe has paid to prevent crossings is more people being exploited, raped and tortured just across its borders. A pan-European approach based on all member states pulling their weight has never looked more distant. Greece, Spain and Italy are processing many more asylum claims than their richer northern neighbours under the Dublin regulation, which stipulates that refugees should be processed by the first EU country they set foot in. Some countries in eastern and central Europe refuse to accept any refugees

 Canada
Canada should increase the number of refugees it accepts
The Brandon Sun, August 22, 2018, Why it is so difficult to deal with the refugee crisis, https://www.brandonsun.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/why-it-is-so-difficult-to-deal-with-the-refugee-crisis- 491422171.html
Under normal circumstances, these agreements, protocols and legislation worked well. Unfortunately, we are not living in normal times. The number of refugees worldwide has increased beyond normal bounds. These are refugees who are trying to find safe haven in other countries, including Canada. These are refugees who are motivated to take any means necessary to accomplish their objective, regardless of whether Canada considers the means illegal.
In accordance with the above-mentioned national and international agreements, protocols and legislation, Canada has a humanitarian and legal obligation to consider legal or illegal refugees regardless of country of origin for eligibility to enter and stay. Under normal circumstances, Canada manages its responsibility by having refugees make their respective claims for refugee status at points outside of Canada. These refugees would be referenced as "legal refugees" subject to normal protocols to define eligibility for entry into Canada.
While the increase in worldwide refugees can be overwhelming for Canada, it is still manageable. What is problematic, as we have seen in the past many months, is an abnormal, probably at one time unthinkable, phenomenon related to the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S.
Under terms of the agreement, persons passing through or living in the U.S. who make a claim for refugee status at a Canadian land port of entry would be returned to the U.S. However, this protocol is dependent upon the Canada defining the U.S. as a "safe" country. Circumstances in the U.S. have given cause for Canada to question whether "legal refugees" making a claim at a Canadian port of entry should be returned to the U.S.
The more pressing issue is what we call "illegal refugees." These include the huge inflow of persons who are entering Canada from the U.S. at other than Canadian ports of entry who then make a claim for refugee status. While these persons are termed "illegal refugees," they continue to qualify for treatment as prescribed in national and international protocols, agreements and legislation.
However cursory and simplified the above discussion, it does give a perspective on how difficult it is and will be to deal with this abnormal influx of "legal refugees" and "illegal refugees."
The financial burden of providing food, shelter, clothing, education and health services falls on provinces and not-for- profit organizations. It's a significant burden on those provinces which are the recipients of "illegal refugees." Because of the increasing backlog of determining eligibility of claimants for refugee status and then the process of determining eligibility for remaining in Canada, the period of support is a significantly lengthy and costly one. Rightly so, these provinces and organizations are seeking financial support from the federal government. Which means some protocol would need to be established whereby federal funds can flow to provinces and organizations incurring extraordinary costs.
The term "illegal refugees" incites calls for various measures to stop the influx of people. Unfortunately, the term is being misused in that "illegal refugee" refers to the claimant who is not following the normal protocol of applying for refugee status at a port of entry. However, the "illegal refugee" still has legal status in terms of being treated and considered in accordance with the laws of the land. Canada could withdraw from the UN 1951 Refugee Convention, it could remove the Charter of Rights and Freedoms from the Constitution Act: 1982. It could, but with great legal and political difficulty.
The influx of thousands of refugees is itself frightening for some in terms of concerns about culture, religion, social cohesion. This is the most difficult issue for a government to address. Even if it were possible to stop an abnormal influx
114
 of refugees, Canada would necessarily have to deal with the issue of Canadian values, beliefs.

 It is easy to call the influx of refugees a crisis. It is more difficult to define the nature of the crisis because of the financial, emotional, moral, ethical dimensions of the issue. It is even more difficult to decide on a path forward which would address each of these dimensions.
It remains for Canadians to engage in a truth-filled discussion of the issue. A discussion which explores what each of us mean when we define the issue as a crisis. A discussion which ultimately explores what it means to be Canadian.

 US Should Increase Refugee Resettlement
Substantially lifting the cap is vital to revitalizing US refugee leadership and obtaining global
buy-in for greater resettlement.
Bagaric, 17 - Lecturer, Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia (Brienna Bagaric, Revisiting the Definition of Particular Social Group in the Refugee Convention & Increasing the Refugee Quota as a Means of Ameliorating the International Displaced Person's Crisis, 69 S. C. L. Rev. 121 (2017)
In this part, I discuss the second aspect of my solution to ameliorating the current refugee and displaced person crisis. This solution involves the United States considerably increasing its intake of offshore refugees. The current United States intake of refugees consists of two main cohorts. There are onshore refugees who are also called asylees.3 27 These figures vary from year to year, but the most recent data shows that there are generally around 26,000 asylees.3 28 The second cohort is offshore refugees. 329 This figure also varies, and the refugee ceiling for Fiscal Year 2017 stands at 110,000, an increase of 25,000 from Fiscal Year 2016, although as noted earlier, the refugee quota has recently been halved.330 These projections are now somewhat speculative given that, as indicated in the Introduction to this Article, President Trump in March 2017 put a freeze on refugee arrivals and has halved the refugee quota.33' These changes make the proposal in this part of the Article even more important and pressing. This is because the United States should in fact significantly increase the number of refugees it admits rather than suspending refugee arrivals. In objective terms, the 110,000 refugee quota established by the previous United States administration is a considerable number but, relatively speaking, the United States still lags behind other developed countries in terms of its pro rata acceptance of offshore refugees. Australia, for example, accepts approximately 10,000 people offshore annually and has a population that is approximately less than 10% of the United States.33 2 The collective sympathy demonstrated by the United States for admitting refugees is also significantly dwarfed by the empathy expressed by other developed countries. Figures in 2016 show that Sweden admitted almost exactly the same number of refugees and asylum seekers as the United States, yet its population is approximately 10 million. Germany, which has a population less than one-third the size of the United States, has admitted four times as many asylum seekers. Even relatively poor developed countries such as Greece and Spain have on a pro rata basis admitted far more asylum seekers .333 The United States is the world's leading and largest economy. It is also the world's third biggest country based on land mass.334 It has more capacity and a greater financial ability to absorb more people than perhaps any other country on earth. In addition, at the geopolitical level, it is the most influential nation on earth and has assumed a role as a democratic and moral exemplar to other nations. The flipside of this is that the United States is morally and politically obliged to meaningfully assist in ameliorating international crises. As we have seen, the number of displaced people is the greatest modern day crisis, as defined by the amount of net human suffering that has and continues to be caused. The number of displaced people is currently at unprecedented levels. While displaced people come from certain geographical regions, the world is now far more integrated than at any point in human history, and the moral responsibilities of individuals and countries are universal. All countries have a duty to assist in accommodating the burgeoning number of displaced people. There is no clear cut, optimal number of displaced people that each country should absorb. As noted by Peter Singer in the context of Australia's refugee quota (the same normative argument applies in the context of the United States refugee quota): [T]here is a strong case for Australia to double its refugee intake. But there was nothing in the argument that relied on the specific level of refugees now being taken by Australia. If this argument goes through, it would also seem to follow that Australia should be taking not an extra 12,000 refugees, but an extra 24,000 refugees a year. Now the argument seems to be going too far, for it can then be reapplied to this new level: should Australia be taking 48,000 refugees? We can double and redouble the intakes of all the major nations of the developed world, and the refugee camps around the world will still not be empty. Indeed, the number of refugees who would seek resettlement in the developed countries is not fixed, and probably there is some truth in the claim that if all those now in refugee camps were to be accepted, more refugees would arrive to take their places. Since the interests of the refugees in resettlement in a more prosperous country will always be greater than the conflicting interests of the residents of those countries, it would seem that the principles of equal consideration of interests points to a world in which all countries continue to accept refugees until they are reduced to the same standard of poverty and overcrowding as the
                                     116

 third world countries from which the refugees are seeking to flee.335 Thus, there is no clear number of refugees which a developed country is normatively obliged to absorb. However, it is clear that by relative standards, the United States is shirking its responsibility to accommodate the growing number of displaced people. There is a desperate and unequivocal need for the United States to increase its refugee numbers. Thus, a fivefold increase is tenable, given the current resources the United States has. I suggest that the intake needs to be incrementally increased to 500,000. This is of course a significant number of people; however, the number is tenable because it is in fact less than the annual intake of Germany in 2015, which has a far smaller land size, population, and gross domestic product than the United States.336 The benefit that would flow from increasing the refugee intake to 500,000 annually would not only manifest in the immense enhanced flourishing of the new arrivals, but it would extend to the United States being able to demonstrably and persuasively establish itself as a world leader in the approach to settling displaced people. It could then legitimately and effectively exert moral pressure on other developed countries to also proportionately increase their own refugee numbers and thereby provide an overarching solution to the current displaced person crisis. This approach and prospective has perhaps never been more important in recorded United States history, given the magnitude of the displaced person crisis and the recent move by the Trump Administration to suspend refugee arrivals. VII. CONCLUSION The number of displaced people in the world is currently at a record high. Governments around the world have been unable to find a mechanism for dealing with the rising tide of desperate people leaving their country of origin in search of a safe destination for themselves and their families. A large portion of the 65 million displaced people are refugees. The legal instrument, which for the past six decades has provided the platform for facilitating asylum for more displaced people than any other, is the 1951 Refugee Convention. Despite the fact that more than 140 countries are signatories to the Convention, this instrument has been ineffective in meaningfully reducing refugee numbers in light of the current massive growth in displaced people. There is currently no strategy for significantly reducing the number of displaced people in the world. Regrettably, recent developments indicate an overall hardening by many countries in their willingness to accept more displaced people. The United States in particular has indicated that it is likely to absorb less displaced people. In this Article, I have argued that the current hardening towards displaced people is misguided and morally objectionable. All countries on earth share some responsibility for accommodating displaced people. This responsibility is especially acute in relation to the United States, given that it is one of the largest countries on earth and economically the most powerful and well-off country. In order for the United States to coherently and systematically increase its refugee intake, I have proposed two reforms. The first is that the definition of particular social group in the Refugee Convention should be expanded, consistent with the approach taken in Australia. This would remove the need for immutable characteristics to be an essential requirement to satisfy this refugee ground. The effect of this would be to broaden significantly the number of people who could qualify as refugees under the Convention. This broader perspective is consistent with the rationale and history of the Refugee Convention and could be implemented in a coherent and systematic fashion. The other reform I have suggested is that the United States proactively settle many more displaced people that are currently located in refugee camps around the world. It should lift its quota to approximately 500,000 people per year from the current 110,000. This is commensurate with the economic and social capacity of the United States to absorb more destitute people and would set a desirable example for other first world countries, thereby significantly ameliorating the displaced person crisis. My proposal will not provide a total solution to the displaced person crisis; however, the approach I take in this Article will hopefully provide a catalyst for a more critical and humanistic approach and reinterpretation of other potential pathways for displaced people to gain asylum.
US needs to lift the refugee cap
| Madeleine Albright and Bob Menendez, September 26, 2018, MENENDEZ, ALBRIGHT OPED: LIFT THE REFUGEE CAP, MR. TRUMP. AMERICA NEEDS MORE., https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-albright-oped-lift-the-refugee- cap-mr-trump-america-needs-more
                                                   117

 Every day, roughly 44,000 people around the world are forced to flee their homes because of armed conflict or the threat of persecution. There are now more forcibly displaced people worldwide than ever before, including many who cannot safely return home or remain where they found refuge.
The mounting toll of this global humanitarian crisis is impossible to ignore. But instead of stepping up to help, the Trump administration is once again fomenting nativist zealotry, inciting fear, and stepping all over America's historic commitment to refugee resettlement.
Since taking office, President Trump has sought to end U.S. refugee admissions entirely and has succeeded in slowing them down to a trickle. And this month, the administration announced that the annual ceiling for refugee admissions would be slashed to 30,000 -- an all-time low.
This repugnant decision turns our back on refugees precisely when U.S. leadership is most needed. It will do untold damage across the world, further undermine America's strength and blemish our global reputation.
Resettlement was a bipartisan source of pride
For decades, both Republican and Democratic administrations held our commitment to refugee resettlement as a point of pride, a reflection of our fundamental values, and a service to our strategic and humanitarian interests. Following the international community's tragic failure to shelter Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis, the United States has demonstrated strong global leadership by providing safe haven to the world's most vulnerable. We admitted thousands of the "Lost Boys" of South Sudan, airlifted Vietnamese after the fall of Saigon, and provided refuge to Bhutanese victims of ethnic cleansing and Kosovar victims of genocide. Following the worst terrorist attack on our nation's soil on 9/11, President George W. Bush set a refugee admissions ceiling of 70,000 and refused to cut it in the years that followed.
As a refugee who fled from fascism and communism in Europe and became America's Secretary of State, and as the son of immigrants forced to flee Cuba who is now a U.S. Senator, we find it impossible to be coldly analytical on the subject of refugees. America served as a beacon of hope for our families, and we refuse to lose sight of the human consequences of turning away those forced from their homes.
Refugees are not statistics. They are widowed mothers, orphaned children, and entire families who are victims of violence, extremist groups, and brutal regimes.
But we did not become a global resettlement leader out of pure altruism. By welcoming refugees, we have aided our economy, strengthened our country and served our foreign policy interests. We have helped those whose lives were in danger because they assisted U.S. troops abroad. Refugees have created diverse, thriving communities in places like Camden and Elizabeth in New Jersey and Denver, Colorado. They become deeply patriotic and hardworking Americans who return more in taxes than they receive in benefits and invigorate towns with new energy and businesses. They are our nurses, police officers, teachers, doctors, agricultural and retail workers.
Refugee resettlement also promotes global stability, and elevates our moral leadership in addressing the world's most complex problems. Countries such as Bangladesh, Jordan, Lebanon, Kenya, Uganda, Turkey, and Pakistan each shelter hundreds of thousands of refugees, and look to us for leadership as they face tremendous domestic pressure to turn away those fleeing violence and persecution. By rejecting our shared obligation to take an appropriate number of refugees, President Trump damages our ability to work with partners, undermines our credibility and cedes critical leverage to hold other countries accountable for their own response to this global crisis. And though the administration claims a strategy of helping refugees "over there," it has twice proposed slashing overseas refugee assistance by almost 20 percent.
Trump needlessly threatens resettlement
In 1980, the U.S. welcomed more than 200,000 refugees, and since then has, on average, admitted an annual average of
80,000 per year. Despite entreaties from nearly every organized faith community in this country, the Trump
118

 administration not only cut the 2018 limit for refugee arrivals to a shocking 45,000, it erected so many arbitrary hurdles that we will fall woefully short of that meager goal. And now, it has cut the ceiling even further for 2019.
Helped by the general chaos and whiplash of the Trump administration's foreign policy agenda, anti-immigrant hardliners have been able to push out seasoned professionals who understand the national security importance of refugee resettlement. At the same time, the White House has continued to publicly fan unnecessary fear over security and stoke economic resentment by routinely distorting the truth about refugees, refugee resettlement, and the Administration's own actions.
But missing from the administration's rhetoric are actual facts: that refugee resettlement to the United States is a longstanding humanitarian tradition; that refugees are still the most vetted category of any traveler to our country; and that refugees are more likely to be victims of crime in the United States than perpetrators. Even a report from this administration's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which it later sought to repress, estimated the net positive fiscal impact of refugees in the United States to be $63 billion from 2005-2014.
As we confront a confluence of unprecedented domestic and international challenges, Trump's decision to lower refugee caps for next year is yet another stress test for our values.
We are a nation that has flourished because of our embrace of immigrants, dreamers, and innovators, and because of our belief in human rights and the dignity of all people. We must continue to be that beacon of light to the darkest corners of the world.
As Americans, we now face a choice: Do we embrace the responsibility of refugee resettlement, live up to our best values, and in doing so continue to lead the world? Or do we follow down this dark and isolationist path, which will leave us morally and economically bankrupt, and alone in the world without allies or partners?

The US should expand refugee resettlement
International Rescue Committee, September 11, 2018, Impact New Service, Why should America take in more refugees? Get the facts on the refugee cap. 11 Sep 2018, https://www.rescue.org/article/why- should-america-take-more-refugees-get-facts-refugee-cap
The United States has long offered safe haven to people fleeing violence, tyranny and persecution. Welcoming refugees is not just a lifesaving humanitarian gesture at a time when more people worldwide are uprooted by war and crisis than ever before. Refugee resettlement also enriches our economy and enhances our national security. Now, as the Trump administration considers how many refugees to accept in 2019, American values, tradition and interests are at stake. Here's what you need to know. Who decides how many refugees can come to the U.S ? The president consults with Congress and sets an annual target for refugee admissions. By law, this ceiling shall be "justified by humanitarian concern or otherwise in national interest." The presidential determination is issued before the new fiscal year (FY) begins on Oct. 1. Prior to the current administration, the average annual refugee ceiling since the 1980 Refugee Act exceeded 95,000. The current administration set the FY18 ceiling at 45,000. In stark contrast, President Reagan twice set a ceiling of over 200,000 to address humanitarian crises, and President Obama set a refugee admissions target of 110,000 for 2017. Within days of inauguration, the current administration cut that number to 50,000. How many refugees will be admitted next year? For 2018, the administration set the lowest refugee admissions ceiling on record, at 45,000. At the current pace, less than half of that number will arrive this year. Why this number won't suffice Traditionally, the U.S admissions ceiling has
   119

 been set commensurate with global humanitarian need, capacity of the U.S resettlement program, and U.S strategic interests. All around the world, people are fleeing war-torn countries at record levels--25.4 million refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18. There's no end in sight to the refugee crisis, as conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, and northeast Nigeria continue to deteriorate. One person is forcibly displaced every two seconds. Only those refugees most at risk--just 1 percent of the total--have a chance to resettle in the U.S or another welcoming country. Most are widows, orphans or victims of rape, torture, religious persecution, political oppression and terror. Some are interpreters in danger because they worked alongside American troops in their countries. Some are persecuted for their religion, or their ethnicity. Refugee resettlement reflects American values 5-year-old Jori walks to school holding her father's hand Although her family arrived in the U.S barely two years ago as refugees from Syria, 5- year-old Jori and her big brother, Majed, 8, are learning English and thriving in their new home in Dallas. Photo: Andrew Oberstadt/IRC Presidents of both parties have ensured that America leads in times of crisis: They've supported refugees who seek liberty, and have rejected ideologies opposed to American values. Republicans and Democrats have raised admissions for refugees fleeing communist uprisings, religious persecution, and tyranny in countries like Vietnam, Cuba, the former Soviet Union, Kosovo, Myanmar and Iran. Today, the U.S must provide unwavering welcome for people fleeing ISIS and other terrorist ideologies. Meet refugees who arrived over the last three decades. Refugee resettlement advances American strategic interests abroad Welcoming refugees helps our allies hosting more than their fair share. In Jordan, 1 in 11 residents is a refugee. The inflow of refugees, mostly from Syria, has overwhelmed Jordan, yet it has kept its doors open. In 2016, it cost Jordan roughly 25% of its annual state budget to host refugees. For more than two decades, Kenya has also welcomed more than its fair share of refugees--hosting Somalis in the world's largest refugee camp. In 2016, developing and middle-income countries generously hosted more than 84% of the world's refugees, while the six wealthiest nations hosted fewer than 9%. If the U.S refuses to do its part, we risk other countries closing their borders, shutting down refugee camps, and forcing refugees to return. This would have catastrophic consequences for regional stability and security - including the security of U.S missions in those regions. But if the U.S continues to lead on resettlement, this encourages other countries to do more. Refugee resettlement is secure The hardest way to come the U.S is as a refugee. Every refugee is hand selected for resettlement by the Department of Homeland Security and screened by security agencies in an exhaustive process--and one that was further strengthened by the current administration. Despite restarting the resettlement program after the travel ban, refugees are arriving in the U.S at a glacial pace with no explanation.

 US Leadership Contention Low refuge acceptance rates reduce US leadership
Connecticut Rep. Elizabeth Esty, August 21, 2018, Connecticut Delegation Urges Secretary Pompeo To Reject Refugee Proposals, https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/connecticut-delegation-urges-secretary-pompeo-to- reject-reprehensible-refugee-proposals
We write to express our concern regarding reports that the Administration is considering a drastic reduction in the number of refugees resettled in the United States. The proposal to shift the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM) to another government agency is also alarming.[1] The State Department has traditionally advocated in favor of refugee resettlement as a key component of American foreign policy, but the United States has closed its doors to the world with cruel policies that will restrict the resettlement of vulnerable refugees and undermine American diplomatic engagement. These proposals will signal to the international community that the United States no longer prioritizes protecting refugees displaced by conflict or persecution. The United States, and Connecticut in particular, has a proud moral tradition and heritage of aiding refugees who need our help when their homelands are in turmoil tradition and heritage that we must maintain today. On behalf of Connecticut residents, we urge you to honor the United States' long tradition of resettling the world's most vulnerable refugees in communities nationwide by resettling at least 75,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2019 and keeping PRM within the State Department. There are tens of thousands of refugees fleeing war, oppression, and persecution throughout the world. News reports suggest the Administration is considering caps of 15,000[2] or 25,000[3] refugees per year, which would represent the lowest cap on refugees admitted to the United States since the establishment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) in 1980. This reduction is even more restrictive than the Fiscal Year 2018 cap of 45,000 refugees, particularly given estimates that the United States will only resettle 20,000 refugees this year. Many nations hosting substantial numbers of refugees do not have adequate resources to support these populations alone and require American support. Decreasing the number of refugees admitted would betray our humanitarian commitments and damage relations with countries that look to the United States for assistance as a world leader.
The U.S. Sends an Unwelcoming Signal to Refugees now
Connecticut Rep. Elizabeth Esty, August 21, 2018, Connecticut Delegation Urges Secretary Pompeo To Reject Refugee Proposals, https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/connecticut-delegation-urges-secretary-pompeo-to- reject-reprehensible-refugee-proposals
More than 25 million refugees around the world have had to flee their origin country due to war, famine, or persecution. Many will spend years in refugee camps, while others-those who can never return home-are placed elsewhere. For millions of refugees, their ultimate destination has been the United States, which has historically been committed to the resettlement of the world's most vulnerable people. But not anymore.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Monday that the country will admit, at most, 30,000 refugees in fiscal year 2019, down from 45,000 this year. It will be the lowest refugee cap since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980. "The improved refugee policy of this administration serves the national interest of the United States, and helps those in need all around the world," Pompeo said in a statement.
The figure is a significant setback for the United States: By sharply reducing admissions, the country is not only diverging from long-standing policy on refugees, but also relinquishing its leadership role in resettlement. Just within the past few years, the country well outpaced others in admitting thousands of refugees. The Obama administration set the refugee cap for fiscal year 2015 at 70,000; by 2016, the number was 85,000. And those numbers didn't just represent lofty estimations:

 The Obama administration came close to achieving both caps, admitting 69,000 people in 2015 and nearly 85,000 in 2016.
Indeed, "cap" is something of a misnomer: Administrations have typically viewed the number as a goal, and have actively tried to reach it. This fiscal year has been different in that regard. While the Trump administration set the 2018 ceiling at 45,000, only around 20,000 refugees were admitted as of August 31, a month before the fiscal year ends in October. Changes to and slowdowns in the vetting process reportedly account for the low number of admissions. If that continues, and there's little expectation that it won't, the administration could be on track to admit far fewer refugees than its new ceiling of 30,000-raising alarm within the top ranks of refugee-resettlement agencies.
"This repeated reduction in the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. is incredibly troubling," said World Relief CEO Tim Breene in a statement. "Not only is it a continuation of a series of unprecedented attacks on our American values and on the humanitarian nature of the refugee resettlement program, but it falls far short of helping the large number [of] vulnerable people around the world."
Melanie Nezer, the senior vice president of public affairs at the resettlement agency HIAS, concurred: "This is a totally inappropriate and shameful number given the number of refugees in the world and the U.S. historic leadership in resettling refugees," she told me. As I reported earlier this month, organizations like Nezer's have had to compensate for the low numbers of refugees by cutting employees and closing offices, which will make resettlement more difficult if and when future administrations raise the cap again.
Since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, the last time the United States admitted fewer than 30,000 refugees was after the 9/11 attacks, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center. The refugee ceiling, which is determined each year, has fluctuated over time depending on global events, but it's always been relatively high. From 1990 to 1995, for example, the U.S. admitted an average of around 112,000 refugees, many of whom came from the former Soviet Union, according to the Pew Research Center. While the U.S. hasn't admitted more than 100,000 refugees in any fiscal year since, figures have generally trended upward year by year.
The Trump administration's decision to slash the number of refugee admissions may not come as a surprise, given its commitment to cracking down on immigration, but it takes aim at a population of people that has largely had bipartisan support. The administration has tried to deter immigrants from coming to the U.S. illegally and to restrict the flow of immigrants through legal avenues. Unique to this situation is the hit the country's humanitarian efforts will take.
Pompeo argued on Monday that the "proposed refugee ceiling should be considered in the context of the many other forms of protection and assistance offered by the United States." He added: "The refugee number should not be viewed in isolation of other expansive humanitarian programs." Even so, a refugee cap of 30,000 marks a drastic shift for the United States-from a country historically receptive to refugees to one seemingly intent on cutting them out.
US accepting refugees has enabled global refugee leadership
Human Rights Watch, August 20, 2018, United States: The US Must Not Turn Its Back On Refugees, https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/401631-the-us-must-not-turn-its-back-on-refugees
In the coming months, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be pressed to make two critical decisions that will determine whether the United States will retreat further from its global role in protecting refugees. First, with President Donald Trump predisposed to drastically reduce refugee resettlement numbers, Secretary Pompeo will need to decide whether to try to hold the line on further deep cuts in the refugee admissions ceiling. He also will need to decide whether to resist White House pressure to eliminate the State Department's refugee bureau. Both decisions will have implications for the world's 25 million refugees and for the stability of the countries where most of them live, including geopolitically sensitive countries such as Turkey, Jordan, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Kenya. But these
   122
  
 decisions also will have broader implications for U.S. foreign policy and the guiding humanitarian principles that traditionally have underpinned much of U.S. global engagement. U.S. leadership in global refugee protection comes not only from its ranking as the top donor for refugee humanitarian response but also as the country that resettles more refugees than any other. This has been a strong bipartisan priority, one that for many lawmakers and policymakers reflects both U.S. interests and values. Because of the depth of its commitment and its history as a haven to the persecuted, the United States has been able to exert critical leadership in shoring up sometimes faltering international support for the countries on the front lines of refugee crises. In September 2016, President Barack Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and pledged to resettle 110,000 refugees in the coming year, as part of his effort to leverage other countries to do more to rescue refugees and relieve the burden on countries of first arrival. But with Donald Trump coming into office after the start of fiscal year 2017, the United States resettled less than half that number - 53,716 - that year. Then the White House set the FY 2018 ceiling at 45,000, the lowest since the passage of the Refugee Act in 1980. Despite that ceiling, the United States is on pace to resettle only 21,000 this year. President Trump's senior adviser Stephen Miller reportedly is pushing to lower the FY 2019 ceiling to 25,000. Some reports say the president would prefer to go even lower - topping out at 5,000. Time after time, the engine that has powered the U.S. leadership drive to mobilize international solidarity has been the State Department's refugee bureau, whose two major functions are managing humanitarian assistance and refugee resettlement. Media reports indicate the White House is thinking about moving the refugee bureau's humanitarian assistance function to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and possibly moving some truncated version of its resettlement function to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Instead of centralizing these refugee protection functions within wider U.S. foreign policy, they instead would become part of U.S. development and immigration policies. Donor governments' role in the development sphere generally is to work cooperatively with the governments of underdeveloped countries to improve economies and infrastructure. The refugee reality is fundamentally about protecting refugees and meeting their humanitarian needs until durable solutions - repatriation, local integration, or resettlement - can be found. In some cases, development may be an aspect of that response, but at the root of most refugee situations are human rights violations that won't be solved using a development model. Furthermore, the tools and skills needed to protect refugees, at times adversarial, are not always found on the development side, where friendly relations with governments usually play a more important role than defending the rights of people living under that government's control. The State Department uses refugee resettlement to leverage other strategic objectives to manage refugee crises - gaining support of other resettlement countries, convincing countries of first arrival not to push refugees back - as part of a tool kit that includes funding and technical and political support. The Department of Homeland Security has no capacity or mandate to perform this function but would approach refugee resettlement largely through an immigration lens. The larger question, of course, is whether taking the refugee bureau out of the State Department would mean more than just shuffling the bureaucracy. Would it reflect the view that candidate Trump expressed during one presidential debate - that the U.S. refugee resettlement program was a Trojan horse bringing terrorists into the United States? Given the evisceration of refugee resettlement since President Trump took office, there is ample reason to suspect the motivations behind reorganizing this bureau. If these two decisions result in essentially ending refugee resettlement and forfeiting U.S. leadership in creating and maintaining asylum space in the regions of conflict, the United States would be closing the valve on the refugee pressure cooker. It would make host governments' management of refugee populations immeasurably more difficult because it would take away the hope of resettlement that makes refugees' years of waiting bearable. If the United States turns its back and closes the door, that would signal to countries on the front lines that it is acceptable for them to close their doors as well, blocking the escape of people fleeing for their lives.
Lowering the refugee cap has gutted US refugee leadership
Priscilla Alvarez, Defense One, September 18, 2018, America's Latest About-Face: Refugee Resettlement
A million refugees around the world have had to flee their origin country due to war, famine, or persecution. Many will
spend years in refugee camps, while others-those who can never return home-are placed elsewhere. For millions of refugees, their ultimate destination has been the United States, which has historically been committed to the resettlement

Refugee resettlement critical to US moral leadership
Congressional Documents and Publications, August 31, 2018 With the Number of Refugees Permitted to Come to the U.S. on Pace for Lowest Number on Record, Senators Call on Trump Administration to Step Up Efforts and Honor America's Legacy as a Safe Haven for Families Fleeing Persecution;
The refugee program Congress established in 1980 solidified our great nation's moral leadership as a beacon of hope and place of refuge for those being persecuted. Moreover, it also served a strategic national security goal.[17] As former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote, "cutting refugee admittances would not only be a moral failure but also damage our national interest abroad [....] Maintaining resettlement commitments is also critical to our military, diplomatic and intelligence operations abroad."[18] Further, as Michael Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, and James Stavridis, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, explain, "hostility to refugees helps ISIS. [...] Conversely, welcoming refugees regardless of their religion, nationality, or race exposes the falseness of terrorist propaganda and counters the warped vision of extremists."[19] National security experts agree on a bipartisan basis that a robust refugee program is vital for our national security, and we are deeply concerned that your actions to reduce refugee resettlement in the past two fiscal years has damaged our military, diplomatic, and intelligence interests abroad. The United States should not fear the world's most vulnerable, nor should we scapegoat victims of terror and repression who seek refuge in the United States. We ask that you take steps to ensure the number of refugee admissions in fiscal year 2018 is 45,000, consistent with the current ceiling. We further ask that you provide a124 significant increase above fiscal year 2018 to the total number of refugees who may be admitted to the United States in
    
 fiscal year 2019. If you have any questions about this issue, please contact Jake Cornett of Senator Murray's staff at 202- 224-0767.

 Moral Obligation Contention Need collective action to fulfill moral obligations to refugees
BAN KI-MOON, New York times, September 17, 2017, the refugee crisis is a test of our collective conscience, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/opinion/politics/ban-ki-moon-refugee-crisis.html
In 1951 a young boy and his family fled their burning village during a brutal war that brought immeasurable death and destruction to their country. He witnessed pronounced human suffering that would continue to haunt him in the days and years to come.
This child uprooted by conflict was me -- the same boy who would grow up to be elected as the eighth secretary general of the United Nations in 2006.
As secretary general, I met so many children around the world, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, who reminded me of my own wrenching experience of displacement. Seeing myself in each of them, I have remained determined to elevate the plight of refugees to the top of the global agenda today.
As of the end of 2017, a record 68.5 million people around the world had been forced from their homes, including 25.4 million refugees, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Only 102,800, less than 1 percent of the total number of displaced, were admitted for resettlement in 2017. Furthermore, data from the Missing Migrants Project shows that nearly 2,000 refugees and migrants died during the first six months of 2018 as they made perilous journeys across borders and high seas.
Despite the scale of the refugee challenge, we need to think of it first and foremost as a crisis of solidarity. Whether the world can come together to effectively support these vulnerable groups will be a true test of our collective conscience.
An increase in political will is urgently needed from our world leaders, as is a readiness to partner with others. This political will must be guided by an enhanced sense of our common humanity, rather than a belief in barriers and barbed wire.
Faced with images of unthinkable suffering from the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, or with evidence of gross human rights violations in Myanmar and elsewhere, too many leaders have lacked the necessary courage to respond with generosity and support. Some leaders have gone so far as to actively encourage prejudice against refugees and migrants simply to win votes.
Countries in the developing world -- Turkey, Pakistan, Uganda, Lebanon, Iran, Bangladesh and Sudan -- are host to among the largest numbers of refugees, while the prosperous nations of the global north have failed (with the exception of Germany) to share the burden fairly. This needs to change.
Wealthier countries must admit and resettle significantly more than the less than 1 percent of the world's refugee population resettled in 2017. Such equitable sharing of responsibility is critical to ameliorating this crisis of global solidarity.
In September 2016, I convened the United Nations Summit for Refugees and Migrants in New York to confront the refugee challenge head-on. At this historic gathering, world leaders committed to developing a Global Compact on Refugees and a Global Compact for Migration, an international negotiation process overseen by the United Nations until its conclusion this past summer. Together, these agreements -- which will likely be adopted by the United Nations later this year -- will help ensure the dignity and protection of refugees, migrants and host communities alike.
126
  
 In particular, the Global Compact on Refugees will allow for better burden-sharing among host countries, while elevating the voices of refugees and civil society groups.
Despite the hard work undertaken by the international community in support of refugees, we must recognize that the global political environment has changed dramatically in recent years. In a number of countries, the global compacts were negotiated in the shadow of populist backlashes that have tapped into and stoked nativist fears about immigrants and their descendants. Some politicians feel that they must be tough toward immigrants, that they must protect their country's borders and national identities. In the United States, the resulting policies have taken on increasingly cruel forms, with children detained and separated from their asylum-seeking parents in violation of the best interests of the child.
The United States' decision to withdraw from the migration pact, announced in December 2017, is a deeply regrettable step that undermines international solidarity. It also hampers efforts by nation-states, international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations and others to increase partnership efforts.
Such partnerships are crucial in easing the suffering of refugees. For example, the United Nations refugee agency and the Ikea-supported company Better Shelter have come together to provide thousands of innovative temporary housing structures for refugees and displaced families in Iraq, Greece and elsewhere. The Japanese government generously supported Better Shelter's housing efforts in Iraq.
In Lebanon, Johnson & Johnson has partnered with the nongovernmental organization Save the Children to provide refugees displaced by the crisis in Syria with access to early childhood development services.
I fondly remember when, in 2016 -- my last year as secretary general -- I witnessed the entry of the Refugee Olympic Team at the opening ceremony of the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. For the first time, refugees were allowed to compete in the Olympics as a stand-alone team. The refugee athletes said to the world: We are young people, just like scores of others, and although we are refugees, we can compete at the highest level.
The huge crowd gathered at Maracan„ Stadium felt the same way: Tens of thousands of people gave the refugee team an extended standing ovation. It was a beautiful moment, full of pride, solidarity and hope.
This is the same spirit in which we must address the global refugee crisis. Only by standing together -- with each other and with refugees -- can we succeed.
Ethical obligation to help the outsider
Gene Monin, Sault Star, November 12, 2018 , Refugees challenge our willingness to share, https://www.saultstar.com/opinion/columnists/refugees-challenge-our-willingness-to-share
Refugees are displaced people who nobody wants Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY).
Since the Second World War, we have the biggest movement of millions of minorities, stateless people, and refugees
fleeing war, genocide, poverty and fear looking for a happier life.
They are unwanted and unwelcome, falling through the cracks of human rights and crisis responses. Their sheer numbers are stretching aid organizations and national budgets and stoking extreme racism.
Instead of welcome, refugees face threats and are being treated like the slaves of old, instead of as human beings like you and I.
We exploit foreign workers to harvest our food but do we treat them as equals? Hannah Arendt, a Holocaust refugee herself, writes: "Slavery's fundamental offence against human rights was not that it took liberty away (which can happen
in many other situations), but that it excluded a certain category of people."
127

 "Slavery's crime against humanity began when it became an institution in which some were "born" free and others slave."
If refugees are treated as stateless people instead of regular immigrants, they end up in limbo, unable to work, settle and assimilate into society.
The Rohingya, people of Myanmar have been declared stateless by the Myanmar government and subjected to genocide and expulsion.
Europe is closing borders to refugees and refusing to allow refugees in sinking boats to land.
Australia consigns boat refugees to live on desert islands indefinitely in harsh and appalling conditions.
America dissuades refugees by separating children from parents and placing them in wire enclosures looking like concentration camps.
Jews after the Holocaust colonized Palestine as a Jewish homeland.
"This produced a new category of refugees, the Arabs, increasing the number of stateless and rightless by another 700,00 to 800,000 people" (Hannah Arendt).
Arab countries refuse to settle the displaced Arabs, and leave them to rot in refugee camps in Jordan or crowded Gaza since 1948.
Refugees are challenging fortunate countries to put their human right principles into practice and share.
It is a modern parable of the Good Samaritan.
Two thirds of those who saw the wounded traveller pretended not to see.
Angela Merkle is the Good Samaritan, taking in one million refugees into Germany when there was no direct gain politically.
By a strange coincidence, it was a little refugee from Myanmar among the trapped schoolboys in Thailand's caves who was the only English speaker who called out to the first rescuer who found them.
He learned English in a refugee camp in Thailand, which refuses to resettle refugees.
The refugees flooding in around the world are testing the rich nations to share their blessings with the have nots.
"I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home. I was naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
"Then these righteous ones will ask, 'Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink? Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing? When did we ever see you sick or in prison and visit you?'"And the King will say, 'I tell you the truth, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were doing it to me!'"

B. Positive Duties Regrettably, we have learned from history and from insight into human moral weakness that threats to human rights will continue to occur. This raises the question of what positive obligations we have to come to the assistance of the displaced when crises in fact occur. To address this issue we can draw on a mode of moral analysis originally developed in the 1970s in the context of debate about who had duties to help eliminate the apartheid regime that separated South African people by race and ethnicity. In that debate, some maintained that only those who had created the apartheid system had a duty to work to overcome it. But a very different ethical approach was proposed by several scholars at Yale University who argued that under certain circumstances persons, communities, institutions, and states can have positive duties to help remedy harms they did not themselves cause. They called their approach the Kew Gardens Principle, for it arose from their reflection on a tragic case that occurred in the Kew Gardens section of New York City in 1964 (Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann 1972). According to press reports, a young woman named Kitty Genovese was viciously assaulted, stabbed, and died a slow death while 38 nearby people watched and did nothing, failing even to call the police. It has since been learned that the initial reports of what happened were not fully accurate (Lemann 2014). But the public outrage stimulated by the press reports points to the fact that most people have a conviction that there can be positive moral duties to aid others in emergency situations. It is not enough to avoid causing harm. In some situations omission can become as morally objectionable as commission. Drawing on this conviction, the Kew Gardens principle argues that an agent has a positive responsibility to help when four conditions are present: (1) there is a critical need; (2) the agent has proximity to the need; (3) the agent has the capability to assist; (4) the agent is likely the last resort from whom help can be expected (Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann 1972, 23-25). Subsequent reflection has added a fifth condition: (5) the action can be taken without disproportionate harm to the one providing assistance. These criteria, of course, cannot be applied mechanically. But they can help us think about the scope of positive responsibilities in the face of the crisis-level suffering that is displacing so many people today. For example, there can be little doubt that large numbers of people are in grave need of protection in Syria and South Sudan today and that this need is driving many from their homes. Those inside the borders of these crisis-torn countries are vulnerable to harms that could lead to their deaths or to violations of other basic rights, and they are in flight because of this vulnerability. The duty to respond to such need falls first upon those whose proximity to the crisis makes them more likely to have knowledge of the need and better understanding of how to respond to it. This means, of course, that the government of the nation where the crisis occurs and local communities within that nation bear the prime responsibility. In South Sudan and Syria, therefore, both the governments and the opposition forces in each country have the negative duty to stop the atrocities that are causing crisis and the positive duty to help lift the burdens of suffering. Duty to take positive action, however, does not end at the national borders of the countries where crisis is present. When people become aware of crisis in a neighboring country or even in a country at a great distance, this awareness leads to what might be called intellectual or psychological proximity. It puts them in moral proximity to those who are suffering. There has been helpful though imperfect response to the duties arising from proximity by the countries neighboring South Sudan. The regional organization of Sudan’s neighboring countries — Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, and Eritrea — is called the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). IGAD has played a diplomatic role in seeking to mediate the conflict within South Sudan that began in 2013, as they did in helping secure the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended the earlier conflict between northern and southern Sudan that ultimately led to the independence of South Sudan in 2011. Regrettably, economic and political self-interest has sometimes distorted the mediation efforts of several countries that are part of IGAD, particularly Uganda and Ethiopia. This has in turn led several countries from outside the region to become involved in an effort known as IGAD Plus, which includes the African Union (AU), United Nations, China, United States, United Kingdom, Norway, and the European Union. A sense of moral responsibility arose in these more distant countries because of their proximity through awareness. These combined regional and global mediation efforts have certainly not been perfect. Nevertheless, a fragile peace process is underway (ICG 2015). Both nearby and distant neighbors can have the knowledge that enables them to make a difference. The criterion of capability also sheds light on positive duties to respond to crises that displace large numbers of people. In considering this issue it has become common to point out that someone who cannot swim does not have a duty to come to the aid of a child who is
        129
 
 drowning if providing the aid requires swimming, while a good swimmer can have a duty to respond. Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan are today already massively overburdened with Syrian refugees. They do not possess the economic and other resources to take in many additional refugees. On the other hand, the resources of the wealthy nations of northern Europe, North America, and the oil-producing Gulf states give them the capability to receive many more refugees and to share the burdens being carried by Syria’s already overtaxed proximate neighbors. The assistance being provided to the countries bordering Syria is woefully inadequate. Capability to assist gives many nations in Europe, North America, and the Gulf a duty both to receive many more Syrian refugees than they have and a responsibility to provide more assistance to Syria’s nearby neighbors (Rummery 2015). The duty to share the burden of assistance to displaced people is proportional to the capability of doing so. Countries with greater economic and political capacities to help have proportionally greater responsibilities to do so. These responsibilities may be carried out by granting asylum and refugee status to more of the displaced, and, perhaps most urgently, by providing economic and other forms of assistance to countries like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan who are already carrying a disproportionate burden. The existence of duties such as these is a consequence of the fact that the responsibility to assist displaced people reaches across national borders. The fact that state sovereignty is not a moral or political absolute becomes clear in face of the needs of forcibly displaced persons. In his work on response to the needs of internally displaced people, the Sudanese scholar and diplomat Francis Mading Deng argued that sovereignty is such an important value because it secures each country’s ability to protect its own people by preventing external powers from taking harmful action within its national boundaries, for example by invasion or colonial exploitation. Deng called this sovereignty-as-responsibility (Deng 1996). Sovereignty does not mean a government is free to do whatever it will within its own borders, such as taking actions that create large numbers of internally displaced persons or refugees. If a government fails to protect its own people, either because it is unable or unwilling to do so, the duty to assist those who are threatened by this failure can pass to the other nations. Thus the responsibility to assist and to protect the rights of persons threatened with or experiencing displacement falls first on their own government. But if their government is unable or unwilling to secure their rights, the responsibility to do so can move to other countries and their people (Martin 2010, 28-31). Deng’s thinking contributed in an important way to the development of the doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), initially proposed by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) and subsequently affirmed at the 2005 UN General Assembly World Summit (UNGA 2005, nos. 138-39; ICISS 2001).R2P states that the international community can have positive duties “to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” Protective action should come in the first instance from people’s own government. Only if that government is failing to provide this protection should other countries consider action. When violations of human rights reach the level of atrocity and lead to the displacement such violations often cause, action by other countries through “diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means” can become appropriate and even required. The responsibility to protect has been the focus of heated controversy since it was endorsed by heads of state at the UN General Assembly in 2005. Political realists oppose it because they hold that foreign policy should be determined by the interests of one’s own people, not by a supposed moral responsibility to other countries. Others see it as a form of neoimperialism. Still others say that the situation in Libya today in the aftermath of the NATO intervention there shows R2P doesn’t work, and that the current massive crisis in Syria and surrounding countries shows the R2P cannot work. Despite these critiques, it is important to note that the responsibility to protect has in fact been invoked on a number of occasions since 2005 and that it has led to effective protection of people from grave rights violations. For example, when conflict flared in Kenya following the disputed 2007 elections, nonviolent, diplomatic initiatives were taken by numerous international actors to stop the conflict that took several thousand lives and displaced half a million people. Kofi Annan stated that he saw the crisis in Kenya through “the R2P prism” (Cohen 2008). This led to intense diplomatic initiatives by the United Nations, the African Union, and a number of other governments from Africa and around the world, including the United States (International Coalition for R2P, sec. II). A power sharing agreement was reached and the downward spiral into civil war and perhaps even genocide was stopped. The Kenyan case illustrates that the responsibility to protect can be successfully carried out through nonviolent political and diplomatic means. The R2P doctrine has also been invoked on several occasions in the past decade to justify the use of military force to protect people from atrocities, following the UN General Assembly’s affirmation that if diplomatic initiatives do not succeed, the use of armed force can become legitimate as a last resort under chapter VII of the UN Charter. For example, in 2012 France and the Economic Community of West African States took military action with UN approval in the pursuit
                         130

 of peace in Mali, and in 2013, the UN Security Council supported the use of force by French and African Union troops to stop the atrocities that were occurring in the Central African Republic and the displacement of nearly one million refugees and other forced migrants.6 Though these cases are certainly not resolved, they indicate that the doctrine of the responsibility to protect can lead to action that can help prevent grave crisis from becoming much worse and can lead to some improvement in crisis situations that force many people from their homes. Two other cases, however, Libya and Syria, raise questions about whether R2P has any relevance to current efforts to respond to the refugee crisis. In the Libya case, the United Nations authorized action to protect civilians when fears arose that Libya’s leader, Muammar al-Qaddafi, was about to commit atrocities. Qaddafi referred to his adversaries in Benghazi as “cockroaches,” the very epithet Hutu used for Tutsi during the Rwanda genocide (BBC News 2011). As a result, the UN Security Council, with the notable support of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States, called for the use of “all necessary measures” to protect civilians.7 NATO intervened with airpower, Qaddafi was killed, and his regime was overthrown. Sadly, Libya has since fallen into political chaos, with armed conflicts among several groups, significant violations of human rights on the basis of religion, the displacement of many, and the unsafe flight of migrants across the Mediterranean (Amnesty International 2015, 5-6). These consequences confirm for some observers the conviction that pursuing humanitarian goals not required by national self-interest is likely to do more harm than good (Kuperman 2015, 66-77). I would argue, however, that the intervention in Libya failed not because it was excessive but because it was incomplete. Following the norms that some specialists in the ethics of war are today calling jus post bellum, justice after conflict, NATO and the United States should have followed up their intervention with action to rebuild and to prevent the chaos that developed (Chollet and Fishman 2015, 154-57). What happened in Libya was an incomplete implementation of R2P, not a simple failure. Had the intervention followed through with the peace building and reconstruction efforts that were clearly required, the situation on the ground in Libya would not have disintegrated in the way that it has, and many fewer people would be in flight from the chaos of that tragic situation. Syria has also been invoked to suggest that R2P is dead. The political complexities and moral ambiguities of the Syrian situation go very deep. But these complexities do not discredit the existence of a duty to protect people facing atrocities when protection is possible. Thomas Weiss has argued that the wisdom of the use of military force to protect people from atrocities is governed by three factors: legality, moral legitimacy, and feasibility (Weiss 2014). In Syria it is clear that the legal prohibitions of war crimes and of other atrocities have been massively violated. The moral legitimacy of efforts to stop a conflict that has displaced over half the Syrian population and killed hundreds of thousands of civilians is also evident. The feasibility of military intervention to alleviate the crisis, however, is unclear. This does not undermine the idea that there is a responsibility to protect people from atrocity and from being driven from home by mayhem when it is possible to do so. The apparent lack of presently feasible ways to overcome the crisis in Syria suggests that intervention is not now called for by R2P. I would argue, however, that the duty to protect the Syrian people does call for continuing political and diplomatic initiatives to find a path toward their protection. Not only Assad and the rebels, but also Russia, Iran, some Gulf states, and others are keeping the crisis in Syria alive. The global community, therefore, has a duty to continue engage these powers diplomatically and possibly through other forms of continuing engagement. There is also continuing responsibility to the large number of Syrians presently seeking refuge in Europe and other parts of the developed world. At a minimum, we need to live up to 1951 Refugee Convention’s call for refugees fleeing persecution to be granted protection. Countries in Europe and North America have the capability and resources to grant asylum or refugee protection to a considerably larger number of Syrians than is happening today. The number of Syrians seeking asylum in Europe is not even close to the number already within the borders of Syria’s neighbors (ICG 2016). When in the fall of 2015 UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced that his country would grant refugee protection to 20,000 Syrians over the next five years, he was appropriately reminded that Lebanon had admitted that many Syrians over the past two weekends. Indeed, developing countries today host 86 percent of the world’s refugees, with the very poorest countries hosting 25 percent of the global total (UNHCR 2015, 2-3). The rich nations of the North have the capability and therefore the responsibility to admit a larger number of refugees and asylum seekers and to assist the poorer countries already hosting most of the world’s refugees. A substantial increase in the funds being provided to Syria’s neighbors for this burden sharing by the North should be a priority today. To achieve this, the rich nations of the northern hemisphere will have to overcome tendencies to racially or religiously driven xenophobia and the mistaken fear that terrorists are often refugees. In addition, European powers such as France and the United Kingdom that gained economically from their colonies in Africa and Asia
                 131
 
 have duties to be open to refugees from these regions. A country with a history of military involvement in another nation can also have special obligations to people in flight from that nation. The United States recognized its particular duty to receive refugees from Vietnam after the Vietnam War. Though the US intervention in Iraq was certainly not the sole cause of the displacement of many Iraqis, it was a significant factor that contributed to the political chaos that led to the huge forced migration of Iraqis that has occurred. Political scientist Stephen Walt recently observed that if the United States and its allies had not invaded Iraq in 2003, there would almost certainly be no Islamic State today (Walt 2015). Thus there would be fewer people from Iraq and Syria seeking asylum and refugee protection. This deepens the duties of the United States and its allies toward those refugees. Finally, it is well known that many observers believe there are good reasons to wonder whether national self-interest may not overshadow the duties and prevent the actions advocated here. Nevertheless, the work of Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink has shown that advocacy for normative standards in some domains of contemporary international politics has had significant positive impact (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). The standards of the international law of refugee protection and for the regulation of armed conflict were the result of normative advocacy by groups such as the Red Cross over the past century. More recently, though the ICC is still a developing institution, “normative entrepreneurs” have advanced the effort to hold political leaders accountable for violating normative standards in several international tribunals. This suggests that, contrary to the standard realist argument, ethical standards can come to have real impact on the conduct of nations. There is hope, therefore, that the September 2016 UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants can lead to genuine innovation in the protection of refugees and other victims of war and humanitarian crisis. Normative pressure from nongovernmental bodies, including religious communities and faith-based agencies, can make important normative contributions to action more fully in accord with the responsibilities incompletely sketched in this article. IV. Conclusion The refugee crisis that is occurring today means that the high moral value that has been assigned to national borders and state sovereignty in the modern, Westphalian international system must be reassessed. Human rights have been proclaimed as universal norms, and this universality can be supported by secular philosophies such as that developed by Kant and by the major religious traditions of the world, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These rights require that all political actors, both states and non-state agents, refrain from grave abuses of human rights such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other abuses that effectively treat people as if they were not human at all. Atrocities such as these are among the major causes of refugee movement and other forms of forced migration today. Acting to prevent such crimes and holding accountable those who nevertheless commit them will be a crucial step in making the global system of refugee protection more adequate. Doing so should be a main objective at the September 2016 United Nations Summit, and elsewhere as well. Similarly, taking positive steps to come to the aid of those who have been driven from home will be essential to a more effective refugee regime. The duty to provide such assistance to those already displaced falls on neighboring countries, on those in the local region, and on the global community as a whole. The responsibility of countries to provide help is proportional both to their proximity to those in need and, more importantly today, to their capacity to provide effective assistance. The rich nations of Europe, North America, and the oil-rich Gulf states thus have urgent duties to assist the very poor countries who are hosting most of the world’s refugees today. Developing fair and politically effective ways of assigning the share of the responsibility that different developed nations should carry will be essential to the creation of a more effective refugee system. It will be a great disappointment if the September 2016 meeting at the UN General Assembly fails to make substantial progress on this task. But while the leadership of the United Nations and its constituent national governments is essential, the task is not theirs alone. Many humanitarian NGOs, both secular and faith-based, have broad experience in responding to the needs of the displaced across national borders. These organizations are thus well positioned to help in the development of a system that is more effective. Hearing their voices will be important as revisions in the refugee regime are being considered. It can be hoped that all available practical wisdom will be drawn upon to create more adequate ways of responding to the present crisis. Many millions of lives are at stake.
Human survival requires that we act based on ethics.

 Even though, as Americans, we have not experienced "by fire, hunger and the sword" n19 the terrible disasters in war overtaking other human beings on their home ground, we know the consequences of human hospitality to evil. We know about human perfidy: the chasm that separates proclaiming virtue from acting decently. Even those of us trained to linguistic skepticism and the relativity of moral judgment can grasp the verity in the stark warning, "If something exists in one place, it will exist everywhere." n20 That the dreadful something warned against continues to exist anywhere should fill us with an inextinguishable yearning to do something. Our impotence to action against the brutality of mass slaughter shames us. We have the historical record to ransack for precedent and corollaries--letters, documents, testaments, books-- written words that would even "preserve their validity in the eyes of a man threatened with instant death." The truths gleanable from the record of totalitarian barbarism cited in them may be common knowledge; they are by no means commonly acknowledged. They appear in print upon many a page; they have not yet--still not yet--sufficiently penetrated human consciousness. Herein lies the supreme lesson for intellectuals, those who have the projective power to grasp what is not yet evident to the general human consciousness: it is possible to bring down totalitarian regimes either by violence or by a gradual transformation of human consciousness; it is not possible to bring them down "if we ignore them, make excuses for them, yield to them or accept their way of playing the game" in order to avoid violence. The history of the gentle revolutions of Poland, Hungary, andCzechoslovakia suggests that those revolutions would not have happened at all, and certainly not bloodlessly, without the moral engagement and political activism of intellectuals in those besieged cultures. Hundreds of thousands of students, workers, and peasants joined in the final efforts to defeat the totalitarian regimes that collapsed in 1989. Still, it was the intellectuals, during decades when they repeatedly risked careers, freedom, and their very lives, often in dangerous solitary challenges to power, who formed the unifying consensus, developed the liberating philosophy, wrote the rallying cries, framed the politics, mobilized the will and energies of disparate groups, and literally took to the streets to lead nonviolent protests that became revolutions. The most profound insights into this process that gradually penetrated social consciousness sufficiently to make revolution possible can be read in the role Vaclav Havel played before and during Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution. As George Steiner reflects, while "the mystery of creative and analytic genius . . . is given to the very few," others can be "woken to its presence and exposed to its demands." Havel possesses that rare creative and analytic genius. We see it in the spaciousness of his moral vision for the future, distilled from the crucible of personal suffering and observation; in his poet's ability to translate both experience and vision into language that comes as close as possible to truth and survives translation across cultures; in the compelling force of his personal heroism. Characteristically, Havel raises local experience to universal relevance. "If today's planetary civilization has any hope of survival," he begins, "that hope lies chiefly in what we understand as the human spirit." He continues: If we don't wish to destroy ourselves in national, religious or political discord; if we don't wish to find our world with twice its current population, half of it dying of hunger; if we don't wish to kill ourselves with ballistic missiles armed with atomic warheads or eliminate ourselves with bacteria specially cultivated for the purpose; if we don't wish to see some people go desperately hungry while others throw tons of wheat into the ocean; if we don't wish to suffocate in the global greenhouse we are heating up for ourselves or to be burned by radiation leaking through holes we have made in the ozone; if we don't wish to exhaust the nonrenewable, mineral resources of this planet, without which we cannot survive; if, in short, we don't wish any of this to happen, then we must--as humanity, as people, as conscious beings with spirit, mind and a sense of responsibility--somehow come to our senses. Somehow we must come together in "a kind of general mobilization of human consciousness, of the human mind and spirit, human responsibility, human reason."

 Europe
  134

 In addition to the US, Europe has the capacity to provide a safe haven for more refugees.
George Soros, April. 9, 2016, New York Review of Books Daily, Europe: A Better Plan for Refugees, http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2016/04/09/europe-how-pay-for-refugees/ DOA: 4-21-16
A humanitarian catastrophe is in the making in Greece. The asylum seekers are desperate. Legitimate refugees must be offered a reasonable chance to reach their destinations in Europe. It is clear that the EU must undergo a paradigm shift. EU leaders need to embrace the idea that effectively addressing the crisis will require “surge” funding, rather than scraping together insufficient funds year after year. Spending a large amount at the outset would allow the EU to respond more effectively to some of the most dangerous consequences of the refugee crisis—including anti-immigrant sentiment in its member states that has fueled support for authoritarian political parties, and despondency among those seeking refuge in Europe who now find themselves marginalized in Middle East host countries or stuck in transit in Greece. Most of the building blocks for an effective asylum system are available; they only need to be assembled into a comprehensive and coherent policy. Critically, refugees and the countries that contain them in the Middle East must receive enough financial support to make their lives there viable, allowing them to work and to send their children to school. That would help to keep the inflow of refugees to a level that Europe can absorb. This can be accomplished by establishing a firm and reliable target for the number of refugee arrivals: between 300,000 and 500,000 per year. This number is large enough to give refugees the assurance that many of them can eventually seek refuge in Europe, yet small enough to be accommodated by European governments even in the current unfavorable political climate. There are established techniques for the voluntary balancing of supply and demand in other fields, such as with matching students to schools and junior doctors to hospitals. In this case, people determined to go to a particular destination would have to wait longer than those who accept the destination allotted to them. The asylum seekers could then be required to await their turn where they are currently located. This would be much cheaper and less painful than the current chaos, in which the migrants are the main victims. Those who jump the line would lose their place and have to start all over again. This should be sufficient inducement to obey the rules. At least €30 billion ($34 billion) a year will be needed for the EU to carry out such a comprehensive plan. This includes providing Turkey and other “frontline” countries with adequate funding to maintain their very large refugee populations, creating a common EU asylum agency and security force for the EU’s external borders, addressing the humanitarian chaos in Greece, and establishing common standards across the Union for receiving and integrating refugees.
Thirty billion euros might sound like an enormous sum, but it is not when viewed in proper perspective. First, we must recognize that a failure to provide the necessary funds would cost the EU even more. There is a real threat that the refugee crisis could cause the collapse of Europe’s Schengen system of open internal borders among twenty-six European states. The Bertelsmann Foundation has estimated that abandoning Schengen would cost the EU between €47 billion ($53.5 billion) and €140 billion ($160 billion) in lost GDP each year; the French Commissioner for Policy Planning has estimated the losses at €100 billion ($114 billion) annually. Moreover, there is no doubt that Europe has the financial and economic capacity to raise €30 billion a year. This amount is less than one-quarter of one percent of the EU’s combined annual GDP of €14.9 trillion, and less than one-half of one percent of total spending by its twenty-eight member governments. It is Europe’s political capacity that is lacking, at least at the moment—its ability to make effective unified decisions about such an urgent matter. Most member states are restricted by the EU’s fiscal rules from running larger deficits and financing them by issuing new debt in the capital markets. Even though German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble lifted hopes in Davos in January when he spoke of a European Marshall Plan to deal with the migration crisis, he also insisted that any spending should be financed out of revenues rather than by adding to the existing government debt.
Taking on new common European debt, backed by the joint and several guarantee of the EU’s members, would raise strong objections, particularly in Germany. Even if the debt were restricted to addressing the migration 135 crisis, Germany and others would see it as a dangerous precedent toward creating debt backed by EU members
      
 collectively, with Germany responsible to step in if other countries fail to repay their share of the debt. Berlin has diligently avoided providing such a precedent throughout the euro crisis. That is why the question has not even been raised, let alone seriously considered. But there are other ways to raise the necessary funds using existing EU structures. Member states could raise new tax revenue in order to fund what is needed. However, Europe does not have the political capacity to raise the necessary sums needed in time to contain the crisis. For a new tax to be perceived as fair, it would have to be imposed equitably across the EU. The proper route for such a tax increase would be for the European Commission to propose new legislation to be adopted with the unanimous support of all members. This would likely fail, since it would give every country the right to veto the tax. If a “coalition of the willing” of at least nine countries could be assembled, the Commission could opt for “enhanced cooperation,” the approach used for the proposed European financial transaction tax (FTT). If the recent experience with the FTT is any guide, this process would take months to conclude.
A more promising alternative would be to re-open the European Commission’s Multiannual Financial Framework, which establishes the EU’s broad budgetary parameters, including the maximum amounts the EU may spend in different areas. The forthcoming mid-term review of this EU budget offers an opportunity to increase the VAT contribution of member states, and designate that some of the new funds raised should go to a refugee crisis fund. This would also be difficult but offers the most realistic path forward. It will be crucial, however, to make a large part of the funding available very quickly. Making large initial investments will help tip the economic, political, and social dynamics away from xenophobia and disaffection toward constructive outcomes that benefit refugees and countries alike. In the long run, this will reduce the total amount of money that Europe will have to spend to contain and recover from the refugee crisis. This is why I call it “surge” funding. Where will the necessary funds come from? There is a strong case to be made for using the EU’s balance sheet itself. The EU presently enjoys a triple-A credit rating that is underused and that allows it to borrow in the capital markets on very attractive terms. And with global interest rates at near historic lows, now is a particularly favorable moment to take on such debt.

 The UK should reduce restrictions on refugees
The Observor, January 6, 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/observer-view-on- britain-failing-in-moral-duty-to-help-refugees The Observer view on Britain failing dismally in its moral duty to help refugees
The result is that Britain’s asylum system is nothing short of disgraceful, imposing enforced destitution on people fleeing war. Asylum claims can take up to 15 years to process, and a quarter of decisions are overturned on appeal. But while their claims are under consideration, asylum seekers are not allowed to work and pay taxes; they are forced to subsist on an allowance of less than £5.50 a day. They are housed in terrible accommodation often riddled with damp and vermin, operated by outsourcing giants such as Serco and G4S, isolated from any support services and denied the English language lessons that would help them integrate. Yes, they may be alive but years of living in these conditions can profoundly affect the physical and mental health of adults and children who have already suffered significant trauma. Britain receives far fewer asylum applications relative to its population than most other European countries. The government has failed to do enough to provide safe routes to Britain for refugees in line with our moral obligations as one of the richest countries of the world. The scheme to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over four years, announced in 2015, was welcome. But why not more, and why not refugees from other conflict-ridden countries? As this scheme draws to a close, ministers are yet to announce what will come next, leaving councils in limbo. The rules on family reunion for refugees in the UK are inhumanely restrictive: unaccompanied refugee children are not even allowed to sponsor their parents to come to the UK. Just 20 unaccompanied children have been resettled in the UK from the rest of Europe under the Dubs scheme – despite the hope of campaigners that it would lead to 3,000 unaccompanied children being welcomed to Britain, and despite more than 20,000 unaccompanied children arriving in Europe in 2017.

 AT: The Right to Exclude
A primary Pro argument is, “Countries Have a Right to Exclude.”
Countries do have some right to exclude immigrants, but it is not very strong and it is almost completely inapplicable to those fleeing unlivable conditions.
Michael Blake, Philosopher, 2003, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Volume 41, Issue 2, Immigration, Jurisdiction, and Exclusion, pages 103–130, Spring 2013
The second objection is more simple, but also potentially more important. It notes, simply, that the structure of the argument is as follows: we can exclude unwanted would-be immigrants, because these immigrants already have adequate rights-protection within their countries of origin, and are seeking now to oblige us to act in defense of their rights. The argument only holds, that is, when there in fact is adequate rights-protection in the country from which the individual is seeking to emigrate. This was, of course, true for me in my emigration from Canada, and it is doubtless true of many would-be immigrants. It is unlikely to be true of most immigrants, however, many of whom are fleeing circumstances that could be described (rather bloodlessly) as insufficiently rights-protecting. This means, of course, that the justificatory story now fails to hold. We are unable to exclude the unwanted migrant, because the story we would have to tell—namely, that we have no obligation to become obligated to protect that migrant's rights—is inaccurate. The migrant would, upon entry into our territory, simply acquire that set of rights-protections to which she is entitled. If we propose to use force to prevent that individual from entering into our territory, we are simply using force to keep her in a morally indefensible situation. There is no possibility of that use of force being legitimate. As such, we might think that the story I tell here—despite its general defense of the right to exclude—is, in fact, considerably more radical than it would at first appear. It would mandate something like a radically revised account of refugee and asylum law, on which we cannot use force to exclude outsiders from entry when those outsiders are coming from countries that are insufficiently attentive to basic human rights. This is, again, an objection to the view if interpreted as a blanket defense of our current practices; it is not, however, an objection I want to reject in its entirety. I will suggest two means by which the objection's force is potentially subject to some limitations, but on the whole I believe the objection to be accurate. Indeed, if we focus on the justification for the use of force, I believe we are likely to arrive at an account of refugee and asylum law on which we are unable to refuse admission to a great many would-be migrants.37 This view of immigration will be, I think, considerably more robust than a related view given by Christopher Heath Wellman, who allows the legitimate state to purchase the right to exclude by devoting an adequate share of its resources and efforts to development in foreign
countries.38 On my view, this is not even in principle permissible. We cannot justify the use of force against one party by citing benefits to others; the justification must be in terms that the coerced party can accept without requiring that party to unduly identify with the interests of others. This is, after all, the lesson John Rawls taught about the separateness of persons: it is wrong to demand that an individual who is treated badly by a coercive institution be mollified by the comparatively greater benefits received by others.39 The idea that we can justify using force against someone whose rights are unprotected by citing the fact that we have helped other people elsewhere seems to fly in the face of this idea. We can only justify the coercive force of the border if we use it against people whose rights are adequately protected in their current homes. To use it elsewhere seems simply to use force to defend an illegitimate status quo; this is morally impermissible regardless of how just our foreign policy might otherwise be. If we are going to limit the rights of immigrants from oppressed countries, then we will have to do so in a manner that defends their right to be treated as a moral equal. Is there any way of doing this? I believe there are, in principle, two ways of doing so, although neither will offer much consolation to those who want to defend the international status quo. The first way begins with the
                    139

 simple fact that the obligation to become obliged is held not simply by an individual state, but by all legitimate states collectively. To return to the modified violinist case: a dying violinist might have a right to have someone offer her the necessary support needed for a decent life, but she does not have the right to pick her favorite agent as provider. Nothing in the picture of basic rights we are imagining here mandates that we are allowed to insist that the general obligation to protect the rights of persons can be made into a particular obligation—that is, an obligation to be pressed against one particular agent—simply through the wishes of the one to whom we are obliged. This means, I think, that the story we can tell about exclusion might have to be more complex. We are not entitled to use force to exclude individuals who want to enter our jurisdiction when they come from jurisdictions that do not adequately protect their rights. But nothing in this says that we are obligated to be the jurisdiction in which those individuals ultimately make their lives. If the burden of refugee flows is one that ought to be borne by the wealthy states of the world collectively, then it is entirely open to a particular state to argue that some other state is refusing its share of the bill. This opens up the possibility that we can develop a secondary moral analysis of what fairness would demand in the allocation of the burdens of doing justice through immigration. It also opens up the possibility of legitimate international covenants excluding individuals when they have passed through rights-protecting countries on their way to their chosen country of refuge. The Dublin Regulation, for example, insists that an individual's asylum claim must be heard by the first European Union state into which that individual enters.40 This regulation may be unfair toward border states, which tend to bear a higher proportional cost from refugee flows; but it cannot be said to be unfair toward refugees themselves. The second sort of restriction we can imagine is more complex—and, potentially, more dangerous. It goes to the idea that we can, under some circumstances, demand that people pay some costs to maintain just institutions. This is, of course, hardly a controversial idea, stated this generally; we accept that individuals have the duty to pay taxes to support just states, for example. But we might similarly think that individuals have the obligation to bear some of the costs involved in setting up just institutions, too. We might, for example, demand that individuals from a particular state bear some of the costs involved in transitioning that state toward democratic legitimacy. These costs, moreover, might include things other than financial burdens; we do, under some circumstances, insist that individuals bear some personal risk in the name of justice. (Most accounts of just war, after all, include the idea that justice is a sufficient ideal to warrant the imposition of a risk of violent death.) So: if individuals want to emigrate to a given country from a non-rights-respecting country, we might want to have the right to insist that those individuals remain where they are, and improve circumstances in their country of origin.41 Is this a sufficient reason for us to think that we can insist that people fleeing from a non-rights-respecting country return to that country and improve it from within? I do not want to reject these ideas entirely; I do believe, however, that they are insufficient to generate anything like a right to exclude would-be migrants from oppressed states. The reason is, I think, the fairly simple one that it is unfair to insist that someone fleeing an oppressive state has more duties to that state than someone outside of it.42 The relationship between that state and the emigrant is hardly that of someone who is a party to an ongoing, valuable relationship, who thereby acquires some duties to the other parties in that relationship. If we did not accept this simply in virtue of the fact that the state is engaging in unjustified coercion, we might accept it in virtue of the fact that the emigrant is actively trying to sever that relationship. To insist that this relationship generates duties, then, is something very much like insisting that an ascriptive fact—a mere fact of birth—is sufficient to generate an obligation. This, however, seems to be morally impermissible. Why, the migrant might ask, should she be asked to bear a higher burden of the shared task of democratizing her country of origin? She was born there, but that hardly seems sufficient to justify a greater obligation to help that place than there is for those lucky enough to be born in more wealthy jurisdictions. (She may have greater knowledge, and therefore ability, to help, but those seem to be separate issues; and, besides which, it seems unjust for us to insist that obligation increases with ability.) The only way, I think, in which we might use the idea of a burden to work for democratization is if the argument treats all parties—current residents and would-be immigrants—as moral equals, with each having an equivalent duty to build the democratic capacity of the state in question. This might legitimate asking the would-be immigrant to bear some costs in rebuilding the state from which they come; but it would equally ask those who currently reside within the rights-respecting 140 jurisdiction to give of themselves to help the shared task of building a rights-protecting world. The idea of a

 special duty to one's home country, I said, was dangerous because it tempts us to see those who come from a place as specially obligated to sacrifice themselves to improve that place. The shared sacrifice, I think, must be actually shared, justly, among all the citizens of the world; it seems hard to imagine that we could actually use these ideas to exclude would-be immigrants, at least unless we ourselves are bearing costs equivalent to those we expect these migrants to pay. This is a test, of course, I do not think any current state is likely to meet. The result of all this is that the right of a state to exclude people from underdeveloped and oppressive nations is likely to prove rather weak. I do not think this is a defect; it strikes me as true that a state that proposes to use force to keep people out of its jurisdiction has to account for the rights of the people against whom that force is directed. I have ignored, here, many relevant questions. We have reason to ask what human rights are those that ought to be defended by international law and by immigration law. We have reason to ask what sorts of considerations other than the protection of basic human rights ought to affect the right to exclude.43 For the moment, I am content to leave these questions to one side. What I have said here, I believe, might give us some reason to think that the right to exclude exists, and that this right is far from able to justify the sorts of policies all wealthy societies currently undertake. We have, collectively, the right to exclude some unwanted would-be immigrants. We should not, however, take any comfort from this fact; much of what we are doing now is profoundly unjust, and should be recognized as such. This defense of a right to exclude should therefore be taken as a plea for reform, not for quietism; we can indeed seek to exclude some unwanted immigrants, but we should not therefore conclude that we are allowed to exclude as we currently do. Justice, I suggest, demands more discussion both of the moral foundations of this right and of the relationship between that right and our own acts. I will, therefore, be quite satisfied if I have shown the need for such a discussion to take place.
Christopher Wellman argues for a right to exclude refugees based on the argument that there is an absolute right to association – that people are free to associate or not associate with any people they desire. There are two basic problems with this argument —(1) the right to association is not an absolute right and (2) a civic community is more than an association
Michael Blake, Philosopher, 2003, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Volume 41, Issue 2, Immigration, Jurisdiction, and Exclusion, pages 103–130,
Wellman's argument is a step forward, in that the right he defends begins with deontic considerations rather than mere interests; it is not, however, without its problems. In the first instance, it is not clear that the right to freedom of association is quite such a strong right as Wellman takes it to be. We regularly weigh this right against the competing rights of others in domestic policy, as we do with antidiscrimination law; the right to freedom of association does not always outweigh such competing considerations domestically, and it is hard to see why it should therefore outweigh them in considerations of immigration.10 The second issue is that Wellman takes the source of the right to be the relations of people in civil society; what matters is that people do not want to deal with one another in public life, to see one another in markets and in churches. This vision makes the fact that people are bound together by politics a merely incidental fact. Individuals have the right to develop a particular picture of what they want their civil society to look like, and then to employ politics to defend that picture. This, to my mind, ignores what is distinctive about a political community, namely, that it is a political community, bound together by ties of law and politics rather than simply by the shared understandings of its inhabitants. Wellman's vision might be more appropriate if we were excluding people from a social reality constituted by the mental states of its members—if, for example, we were excluding people from a society of people gathered together out of a shared love of knitting (for, presumably, not loving knitting with adequate fervor). What is striking about politics, though, is that it applies to the members of a given jurisdiction regardless of what happens to be in those members' heads. Wellman's analysis, while powerful, reduces politics to an accidental aspect of what is shared in a society; such a reduction, on my view, is a reason to regard Wellman's account as flawed.

 AT: The National Interest
Since many Pro debaters will make a strong defense of acting in the “National Interest,” I will address it in more detail here by making a list of arguments that you can make against it.
One, the concept is too vague to prioritize. There are many different definitions of the national interest and it means many things to many different people. I covered this problem in more detail and with definitional support in the first essay.
Two, if we interpret the ‘national interest’ to be what is in the interest of the country in terms of preserving its absolute power (a realist perspective), it means questions of morality are ignored.
John Baylis, Professor of International Politics, University of Wales, Alternative Nuclear Futures: The Role of Nuclear Weapons in the Post-Cold War World, eds. Baylis and O'Neill, 2000, p. 71
For some realist writers, the laws of morality cannot be applied to nuclear weapons or indeed to any weapons of war. Given the cultural diversity of the world in which we live and the lack of consensus on a universal moral code, ethical issues are regarded as being irrelevant to policy decisions about the use, or threat to use, nuclear weapons. According to this Machiavellian view, a nation's national interests are - or should be - all that considers in its interactions with other nations. Prudence is seen as having a higher priority than morality.
This leads to decisions like the one to drop nuclear bombs on Japan.
Francis Harbour, Professor of Government, George Mason University, THINKING ABOUTINTERNATIONAL ETHICS, 1999, p.95.
From the basically realist perspective that virtually the entire U.S. government applied, by early summer 1945 there was every incentive to use atomic bombs in any way that would bring the end of the war sooner. Virtually all costs to the United States at this point were "sunk costs." That is, the enormous expense of designing the first atomic bombs and putting them into production and the lesser costs of training the crew had already been incurred, whether or not the bombs were used. The only new costs to the United States were a few planes, crews, and observers -and the actual bombs themselves. Not giving the Japanese explicit warning of an atomic bombing to come even eliminated the possibility of loss of "face" if the bombs turned out not to work after all. No other potential alternative could significantly reduce costs to Americans, since these were already so low.
And, to argue that the national interest is a trump card is really absurd -- certainly there are other moral obligations and it would be immoral to ignore them.
Luke William Hunt, 2014, Human Rights Quarterly, The Global Ethics of Helping and Harming, v. 36(4), pp. 798-819 (Luke William Hunt is on fellowship at the University of Virginia, where he is pursuing a Ph.D. focused on philosophy of law and political philosophy. Prior to beginning his doctoral studies, he completed law school and was a law clerk for Judge James P. Jones, United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He then worked at the US Department of Justice for six years.)
In order to clear a path for a more robust conception of a state’s positive duties, Buchanan critiques two justifications for the Permissible Exclusivity Thesis: (1) the Fiduciary Realist Justification and (2) the Instrumental Justification. The Fiduciary Realist Justification is based upon the idea that state leaders—as
  142

 fiduciaries—are morally required to act in ways that maximize the national interest. Buchanan points out several inconsistences with this justification, but his central problem with the Fiduciary Realist Justification seems to be that it requires state leaders to subordinate all other moral duties to the single moral duty of conducting foreign policy for the national interest. He rightly explains the absurdity of this view with various analogies relating to the duties of individual persons: “If I agree to become your guardian or your financial counselor or your doctor, this does not relieve me of all pre-existing moral obligations, and it certainly does not extinguish those obligations that are the correlatives of human rights.” More
colorfully, the fiduciary role of a parent does not relieve one’s moral duty to not “kill someone else’s child and take its liver to transplant into her own dying child.”14 Of course, these points would be equally obvious to any natural duty theory that holds national interest to be the first priority of the state, in other words, any theory holding that there are basic moral requirements. Assuming there exists some sort of minimum moral duty (e.g., a negative duty not to harm others), joining some sort of association (a state, a club, a profession, etc.) does not relieve that minimum moral duty. Indeed, Buchanan’s critique of Fiduciary Realism gets off the ground only because he likens it to a very strict form of so-called Hobbesian realism, which views states as being analogous to individuals in Thomas Hobbes’s non-moralized state of nature.
Three, Affirmative teams need to minimize any harm to the national interest. For example, if the Negative makes a terrorism argument, Affirmative teams need to argue that terrorism is not a significant risk. If the Pro concedes that meeting the needs of the refugees will somehow destroy the national interest/the nation state, it will not be persuasive to argue that we should not prioritize it.
For example, we can certainly afford to take more refugees; it’s just a question of whether or not we want to spend the money.
Amanda Taub, 9-5-15, Vox, Europe’s refugee crisis, explained, http://www.vox.com/2015/9/5/9265501/refugee- crisis-europe-syria DOA: 9-7-15
That problem would be much easier to solve if it were just a question of money. Europe is wealthy, and so are Australia and the United States. There is no doubt that we could bear the costs of resettling and sheltering the refugees who need help, even with their growing numbers. And in the long run, such a program would likely pay for itself: immigration tends to be a net economic positive for immigrants and their new home countries alike. But the problem isn't really about money. Rather, the challenge is about overcoming the domestic political forces that drive nativism, right-wing populism, and anti-immigration policies. The political forces are complex, but they often come down to an anxiety about change.
And even resettling all of the refugees in Europe would not be that big of a deal.
Martin Wolf, September 22, 2015, Financial Times, A refugee crisis that Europe cannot
escape, http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3967804c-604b-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3mTKajB48 DOA : 9-22-15
The number of accepted asylum seekers this year would still amount to only 0.1 per cent of the EU’s population, hardly an unmanageable figure. The numbers reaching the EU are also small relative to the total number of refugees. The number of forcibly displaced people in the world at the end of last year was 59.5m. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the displaced remain within the borders of their own countries, while 86 per cent of all refugees are in developing countries. Turkey hosts at least 1.7m, Lebanon 1.3m and Jordan 1m. Given the size and prosperity of the EU, the task it faces is relatively trivial,
143

 Fourth, teams should argue that they are simply arguing that the needs of refugees should be prioritized at the moment, not that the national interest should be sacrificed. A pretty strong case has been made above for prioritizing it.
Fifth, ignoring foreigners in order to protect the national interest threatens the human rights of foreigners.
Luke William Hunt, 2014, Human Rights Quarterly, The Global Ethics of Helping and Harming, v. 36(4), pp. 798-819 (Luke William Hunt is on fellowship at the University of Virginia, where he is pursuing a Ph.D. focused on philosophy of law and political philosophy. Prior to beginning his doctoral studies, he completed law school and was a law clerk for Judge James P. Jones, United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He then worked at the US Department of Justice for six years.), p. 804
Buchanan takes issue with this view for a number of reasons, including because he believes that exclusively pursuing the national interest is not the best way to respect the human rights of foreigners. For example, he argues that there are a great many instances in which a state’s exclusive pursuit of national interest results in harm to persons in other states.

 AT: Terrorism
A core argument that will be made by many Pro debaters is that we cannot prioritize providing a safe haven for refugees because such a safe haven will increase the risks of terrorism.
The Pro will highlight their argument with the fact that one of the terrorists who took part in the massacre in the concern hall in France a couple years was found with a Syrian passport next to him and there is reason to believe this
person moved with migrants seeking refuge in Europe.
CNN reported on November 15, 2015:
One of the men who attacked Paris held an emergency passport or similar document, according to an unnamed French senator who was briefed by the French Ministry of the Interior. The senator told CNN the bomber falsely declared himself to be a Syrian named Ahmad al Muhammad, born on September 10, 1990, and was allowed to enter Greece on October 3. From there he moved to Macedonia, then Serbia and Croatia, where he registered in the Opatovac refugee camp, the lawmaker said. Eventually, he made his way to Paris, where he was one of three men who blew themselves up at the Stade de France. Fingerprints on the passport matched those of the Stade de France bomber, the French senator told CNN. The fingerprint was not in the French database, the senator said, and therefore officials believe the man was among a group of refugees and migrants. The two others who detonated themselves at the stadium carried false Turkish passports, the French senator said. "This is what we had feared," a senior French official told the Wall Street
Journal. European officials told CNN that they believe a new professional squad of terrorists is inserting itself into some of these migrant voyages. Pope Francis had already thought about this possibility back in September. He told a Portugese radio station, "It's true, nowadays, territorial security conditions are not the same as they were in other periods (of mass migration). ... The truth is that just 400 kilometres (250 miles) from Sicily there is an incredibly cruel terrorist group. So there is a danger of infiltration, this is true," The Telegraph reported.
Although this argument is intuitively strong, there are a number of compelling answers two it.
First, it is important to minimize the link between the Paris bombing and any terrorist threat via refugees.
One, even assuming this person was a terrorist who entered with the refugees, the attacks would have occurred anyhow. There were at least six other terrorists that are all citizens of Belgium and France and they would have committed the attacks. At the site of greatest violence -- the Bataclan -- where 80 people were shot, one of the terrorists was a French national. There are already 5,000 potential terrorists in France who are French citizens, in addition to those other countries.
Two, at least one of the other terrorists (now they are saying two) was from Belgium. It also appears that the attacks were planned from Belgium. Should all countries close their borders to everyone? This would collapse the global
freedom of movement and make trade impossible. Since there are 5,000 suspected terrorists in France, should the US not allow French nationals into the US? Should it exclude Belgium nationals?
145
           
 Religious fundamentalist terrorism will not be solved by excluding refugees.
Erasumus, November 15, 2015, Economist, No European Democracy has the perfect answer for handling Islam, http://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2015/11/europe-and-islam?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/europeandislam DOA: 11-15-15
Even before the latest attacks, it was clear that the leading governments of Europe faced broadly the same dilemma. Within the large and growing Muslim communities which every European state now hosts, a minority is attracted by the cause of violent extremism, at home or abroad.... France has done its collective best to offer Muslim citizens a hard secularist bargain: accept the ideals of the republic, which include the religious neutrality of the state, and you will be as free to practice your religion as any Catholic, Protestant or Jew. It has more-or-less successfully imposed that bargain on the organisations which speak for Islam in France. But inevitably, there are those who reject it. For the great majority of French citizens of Muslim heritage, the republic's offer is probably acceptable. But if only 1% of young French Muslims radically reject it that is easily enough to provide terrorist movements with ample recruits.
 146

 We can separate terrorists from deserving refugees, including orphans and women.
Al Weaver, 11-15-15, Washington Examiner, Obama not ‘reconsidering’ plan to bring in Syrian Refugees, http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-not-reconsidering-plan-to-bring-in-syrian- refugees/article/2576398 DOA: 11-15-15
When pressed by "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace, White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said they are not "reconsidering" their plan to take in nearly 10,000 Syrian refugees, a plan that has been panned by many GOP 2016 candidates in the wake of the brutal terror attack, which left 129 dead and 350 injured. One of the attackers in the French slaughter was carrying a Syrian passport that seemed to indicate that he had been a refugee that had come into Europe along with a flood of migrants in October," Wallace said. "Given that, is President Obama reconsidering his plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year?" "No, Chris, we're still planning to take in Syrian refugees," Rhodes said. "We have very robust vetting procedures for those refugees. It involves our intelligence community, our national counter-terrorism center, extensive interviews, vetting them against all information." "What we need to be able to do, frankly, is sort out that foreign fighter flow, those who have gone into Syria and come out and want to launch attacks or those who have connections with ISIL in Syria," Rhodes said. "We need to be able to have the intelligence base to identify and target those people." "At the same time, we have to recognize there are tragic victims of this conflict," he added. "There are women, children, orphans of this war, and I think we need to do our part, along with our allies, to provide them a safe haven."

 The screening procedures in place for refugees are stricter than other visitors

But the United States has a "strong track record" for screening refugee applicants, Anderson said. "It is more thorough and careful than the screening for tourist and student visas to the United States. A tourist with a French passport does not need screening or a visa; a refugee from Syria must pass multiple careful tests for eligibility." Elizondo echoed that thought, noting that refugees must pass security checks and multiple interviews before entering the United States.

 U.S. Refugees vetting is very thorough

In fact, the US has extremely stringent vetting processes and standards for refugee resettlement candidates — standards so cumbersome and onerous, requiring mounds of paperwork and series of interviews, that even refugees who perfectly qualify must wait months and are frequently turned away. In Europe, refugees arrive in huge numbers to places like Greece and Italy. European governments do indeed have security controls in place, but the scale and immediacy of the problem is simply leagues beyond anything America faces. Boats of refugees are not washing up on the Maryland shore. We only need to resettle as many refugees as we choose to, and we can put them through whatever process we like before they arrive. And that process is indeed a doozy. Slate's Williams Dobson sums up the process here:
It takes anywhere from 18–24 months for a Syrian refugee to be cleared to live in the United States. First he or she must be registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. This agency interviews refugees, conducts background checks, takes their biometric data, and establishes whether they belong to one of roughly 45 "categories of concern" given their past lives and work history in Syria. Typically, the applicants are women and children. If anything looks amiss, they are pulled from consideration. Then the U.S. government begins its own vetting. The applicants are interviewed again, and their names and particulars are run through terrorism databases. They receive additional screening when they arrive in the United States and then again after their first year in the country. Yet to listen to anti-refugee politicians, you would think that none of these safeguards or processes existed. So when, for example, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder demands that the Department of Homeland Security look into security vetting processes, and insists he will accept no refugees until it does, it's a little like angrily insisting that his state will allow no commercial flights until the Federal Aviation Administration provides some answers on its plan to prevent midair collisions. The FAA does have a plan. It's a good plan. And we know this because it's been doing it successfully for years. Four, the authorities investigate d the passport and found that it was a fake. Yes, someone supported by ISIS did travel to Europe from Syria with a fake passport in the refugee flow, but ISIS has enormous financial resources and could generate fake passports with other nationalities. Are we going to exclude everyone from entering the US until they are "thoroughly vetted"?
Four, this argument is rather offensive and arguably racist. The US already resettles 70,000 refugees per year and has resettled over 700,000 since September 11th, 2001 (this includes refugees from Iraq, where ISIS is also substantially present). Not a single refugee has committed a terrorist attack in the US. ONE person who disguised himself as a refugee entered Europe this year (out of one million!) has engaged in terrorist activity, and through an event that would
have likely occurred without him; the other terrorists were European nationals.

 Terrorists are sophisticated and do not need to rely on smuggling terrorists in disguised as refugees.

Germany’s defense minister is pushing back against the idea that terrorists are entering Europe as refugees. European officials have expressed concern after a passport discovered close to the body of one of the Paris attackers was found to have been used last month passing through Greece and the Balkans. Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday that linking Europe’s migrant crisis to the threat of terrorism would be wrong. She says that “terrorism is so well organized that it doesn’t have to risk the arduous refugee routes, and the sometimes life-threatening crossings at sea.”
Think about it. ISIS has adequate financial resources to fly potential terrorists anywhere in South America and then they could make their way into the US with other illegal immigrants. This US has been completely ineffective in reducing illegal immigration. Why would a terrorist even try to enter the US as a refugee and subject himself or herself to an extensive vetting process when they could more easily enter this way.
  150

 If Developed countries start excluding refugees, even more will pour into Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey, risking the collapse of these countries.

If Europe slows or stops Syrian migration, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan will totter, or even tumble, under the weight of refugees. Each nation already hosts nearly 1 million displaced people. The cost of feeding and housing these displaced people is enormous–as are the security risks. Turkish and Arab officials fear that strain could bring down their governments or that the war will follow the refugees into their tent cities. Crime is climbing, both among refugees and between refugees and natives. And the coming winter will only make some of the desperate still more dangerous.
  151

 And if these countries collapse, there will be even more war, more terrorism, and more refugees.

East” http://www.hoover.org/research/instability-middle-east, DOA: 11-15-15
Since the mid 1990s we see some decline and a leveling out, despite the outbreak of several large-scale conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Quite a few civil wars, many of them long running, ended in the second half of the 1990s, in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa (though almost as many started in the late 90s in Africa). Since 9/11 and the Arab Spring, however, new state failures have been concentrated in the MENA region, with dramatic instances in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen. Three of these were middle-income countries not too long ago. Syria and Iraq had developed business sectors. Iraq, Syria, and Libya had all attempted nuclear weapons programs, with various degrees of competence. Although civil wars are not new to this region – or to these states, excepting Libya—the degree of state collapse is of a whole new order in all of them. Further, the prospects for a return of stable central control in Syria and Iraq do not seem good. State collapse and failure in this region is much more consequential for U.S. economic and security interests than in sub-Saharan Africa because it raises the risk of a spread of civil wars and state failures to other states in the region that are important for regional and international stability—Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Pakistan. Refugees put direct strains on neighboring states’ economies and political balances. Regional conflict over the failed states increases militarization, cross-border support for insurgents or opposition movements in regional adversaries, and risks of regional interstate military conflicts (including, to give just one example, more war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon). State failure encourages the transnational jihadi movement, gives it recruits and training, some of whom will return to plot attacks in their home countries and perhaps in Western countries as well. And all this takes place in a region with states that have the capability (before they suffer major failure or collapse) to mount serious nuclear weapons programs, or to purchase weapons.
Even if these terrorists wouldn't then make it to the US, there would be more terrorism in this area, where US citizens vacation, work, and study. And the lives of US allies would be at-risk as well.
If Con teams argue that Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey should also reject refugees, you should make a couple of arguments.
One, there is no evidence that these really can. These countries border the conflict zones and there is no evidence that they can stop millions of people from entering their countries. Even Europe can't really block the flow.

Europe has struggled to find a common policy to address the humanitarian crisis, resulting in a massive influx of largely unregulated migration. Security deterrents such as border fences have done little to stop people seeking safety and asylum, as constantly shifting routes result in new ways for people to enter the continent. " It really is a very dangerous moment for Europe; right-wing politicians are taking advantage of this horrific massacre to try to whip up anti-immigrant sentiment, but it’s a moment for Europe to pause and really think about what lies ahead,” Peter Bouckaert, emergency director of Human Rights Watch, told The WorldPost. “It’s simply impossible for Europe to shut the door on the flow of people trying to come to Western Europe; they will continue to come,” he continued.

Let's concede the point that our rigorous and slow screening system will fail in some small percentage of cases and that we will admit some number of people who turn out to be bad. If that is enough to stop all Syrian refugees from finding shelter here, why do we grant visas—and we grant many of them—to people from that part of the world at all? Why do we let students come here from the Persian Gulf? Why do we let tourists come here from just about anywhere? And, more to the point, why have we let refugees come here from all sorts of nasty places in the world? Each refugee community brings with it a certain number of bad apples. But I wouldn't give back the Mariel boatlift, though it involved a fair number of Cuban criminals. The United States also sheltered a large number of Iranians after the Revolution in 1979. We are, by a few country miles, the world's leader in refugee resettlement. To suddenly say that the risk of ISIS infiltrating this particular refugee flow makes it categorically different from all others is really a backhanded way of saying that we should make a different set of security presumptions about Arabs, even those we know to be victims of the worst forms of oppression by our own military enemies. The sentiment is not just ugly. It may also be profoundly self-defeating in security terms. Yes, if we admit tens of thousands of refugees, we will likely admit some who will give the FBI headaches. We will also create a community that values American liberty and religious freedom, that engages constructively with our economy and with our law enforcement and that sees this country as part of the solution to—or at least a haven from—the tragedy that is Syria.

Merkel's deputy warned Saturday against cracking down on migrants coming to Europe because of the Paris attacks. Vice- Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said those seeking refuge in Europe shouldn't be made to suffer just because "they come from those regions where terror is being exported to us and to the world." "We stand to protect them too, and to ensure that they don't have to suffer because murderers in France are threatening people and Europe in the name of a religion," he said.

If the refugees are treated as a short-term humanitarian problem rather than as a long-term integration challenge, then we are likely to see this problem worsen. Radicals will be among those who provide the religious, educational, and social support for the refugees – creating a problem where none existed. Indeed, the refugees need a comprehensive and long-term package that includes political rights, educational support, and economic assistance as well as immediate humanitarian aid, particularly if they are admitted in large numbers. If they cannot be integrated into local communities, then they risk perpetuating, or even exacerbating, the tensions between Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Europe. Despite their current gratitude for sanctuary in Europe, The actual security risks now are low, but the potential ones are considerable if the refugee crisis is handled poorly.

 ISIS wants us to exclude refugees, because the refugees are currently considered enemies of ISIS and it will make the caliphate more appealing relative to the US.
Zach Beauchamp, November 17, 2015, Vox, Turning Back Syrian Refugees Isn't Just Wrong -- It Helps ISIS, http://www.vox.com/world/2015/11/17/9747042/paris-attacks-isis-refugees DOA: 11-17-15
At least 23 US governors said on Monday that they'd attempt to block any efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in their states, and the few Republican presidential candidates who didn't outright declare that all Syrian refugees should be banned from entering the United States suggested that only Christian refugees should be allowed in. But such reactions play right into ISIS's hands. ISIS despises Syrian refugees: It sees them as traitors to the caliphate. By leaving, they turn their back on the caliphate. ISIS depicts its territory as a paradise, and fleeing refugees expose that as a lie. But if refugees do make it out, ISIS wants them to be treated badly — the more the West treats them with suspicion and fear, the more it supports ISIS's narrative of a West that is hostile to Muslims and bolsters ISIS's efforts to recruit from migrant communities in Europe. "It makes them look bad," Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, explains. Refugee flight from Syria "undermines IS’ message that its self-styled Caliphate is a refuge," Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, writes on the site Jihadology. "If it was [a refuge as they claim], individuals would actually go there in droves since it’s so close instead of 100,000s of people risking their lives through arduous journeys that could lead to death en route to Europe." To demonstrate his point, Zelin looked through a number of ISIS's public statements on the refugee crisis. ISIS speakers "warn that the ‘Jews and Christians’ do not have their interests at heart, and will force them to convert in order to remain in their countries," he found. "They assert that the Islamic State will remain strong despite those leaving. [Refugees] will find happiness only in the land of the caliphate."

 Refugee restrictions will also radicalize more Muslims living outside the caliphate.

The Islamic State's strategy is to polarize Western society — to "destroy the grayzone," as it says in its publications. The group hopes frequent, devastating attacks in its name will provoke overreactions by European governments against innocent Muslims, thereby alienating and radicalizing Muslim communities throughout the continent. The atrocities in Paris are only the most recent instances of this accelerating campaign. Since January, European citizens fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have provided online and material support to lethal operations in Paris, Copenhagen and near Lyon, France, as well as attempted attacks in London, Barcelona and near Brussels. Islamic State fighters are likely responsible for destroying the Russian airliner over the Sinai. These attacks are not random, nor are they aimed primarily at affecting Western policy in the Middle East. They are, rather, part of a militarily capable organization's campaign to mobilize extremist actors already in Europe and to recruit new ones.

 The fewer refugees developed countries lets in, the better for ISIS. This is magnified if we leave refugees stranded in the camps.

It is worth reflecting at least briefly on the security risks of turning our backs on hundreds of thousands of helpless people fleeing some combination of ISIS and Assad. Imagine teeming refugee camps in which everyone knows that America has abandoned them. Imagine the conspiracy theories that will be rife in those camps. Imagine the terrorist groups that will recruit from them and the righteous case they will make about how, for all its talk, the United States left Syria to burn and Syrians to live in squalor in wretched camps in neighboring countries. I don't know if this situation is more dangerous, less dangerous, or about as dangerous as the situation in which we admit a goodly number of refugees, help resettle others, and run some risk—which we endeavor to mitigate—that we might admit some bad guys. But this is not a situation in which all of the risk is stacked on the side of doing good, while turning away is the safe option. There is risk whatever we do or don't do. Most profoundly, there is risk associated with saying loudly and unapologetically that we don't care what happens to hundreds of thousands of innocent people—or that we care if they're Christian but not if they're Muslim, or that we care but we'll keep them out anyway if there's even a fraction of a percent chance they are not what they claim to be. They hear us when we say these things. And they will see what we do. And those things too have security consequences.

 Turn - We will discredit the appeal of radical Islam if we treat the refugees with compassion.

As François Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, argued in the Financial Times Saturday, how other countries respond to the attacks in Paris will determine whether the Islamic State succeeds. They will succeed if the world treats refugees fleeing from their terror in Iraq and Syria as terrorists. The threat of terrorists using the cover of refugees to infiltrate Western societies is real, as is the radicalization of Muslims already living in the West. But vetting and surveillance are better, more precise tools than closing borders against the agony of people who are overwhelmingly victims of the same threats the West is afraid of. Norway-based activist Iyad el-Baghdadi has made a compelling case on Twitter
that compassion for those victims is a major element of how the West discredits the Islamic State’s appeal and positively shapes attitudes in the Middle East. Obama should not only be the West’s leading voice, but he should also adopt policies that others can emulate instead of treating Syrian refugees as a European problem.

 Turn - Demonstrating humanitarianism toward refugees is way more likely to prevent terrorism than the war on terror
Jesse Berne, 11-14-15, Rolling Stone, After Paris Attacks, Don’t Close Our Borders to Refugees – Open
Them, http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/after-paris-attacks-dont-close-doors-to-refugees-open- them-20151114 DOA: 11-15-15
There will be more calls in the coming days to close the United States' borders to refugees, and in France and the rest of Europe, those voices will likely be deafening. Already in the midst of a refugee crisis, European nations may give in to anger and fear and shut their doors for good. Congress will urge President Obama to do the same and cancel modest plans to resettle some refugees from Syria. But we should do the opposite. When we see attacks like the horror in Paris, we should open our borders to a flood of refugees, not close them. We should shower those families with generosity. We should make sure they have jobs that fit their skills. We should educate their children. We should provide them health care and whatever social services they need. The West should do everything in its power to make those fleeing ISIS and extremism everywhere feel welcome and wanted. We've been at war with terror for nearly a decade and a half now. We killed Osama bin Laden. We replaced hostile governments in Iraq and Afghanistan with client states. We defeated tyrants, yes, but we left chaos in their place. And nothing we have done has stopped the tide of terrorist recruitment. One eyewitness account from Paris described a shooter in the Bataclan theater as 20 to 25 years old; that would have made him a child on 9/11. How do we stop the next generation of terrorists from radicalizing? Bombing them sure doesn't seem to be doing the trick. Keeping open the prison at Guantanamo Bay isn't doing it either. Eliminationist rhetoric directed at Muslims isn't going to convince terrorists not to attack us. To win the War on Terror, to actually defeat the terrorists, we have to dry up their recruiting once and for all. We have a chance of doing that by showing Muslims everywhere – Muslims targeted by terrorists in their homeland – that we stand with them as fellow humans, and that when they face violence and oppression in their homelands, we should welcome them in ours. Even if the Paris terrorists turn out to have come from Syria – a Syrian passport was reportedly found at the scene of one bombing, though it may not have been real, and ISIS has claimed responsibility – we should still open our doors to more Syrians and other Muslims escaping extremism. It will take a very long time to make a difference – generations. But if we want a world where terrorists can no longer recruit young people to give their lives to senseless murder, we have to show that the United States is not their enemy. Welcoming those fleeing terror is a critical first step. And rejecting refugees won't keep terrorists determined to attack us from finding a way in. Yes, in the short term we will ramp up our military effort against ISIS in an attempt to find some kind of justice for the deaths in Paris. But so long as we meet death only with death, the only associations we are creating in future generations with the United States and our allies are ones of pain and, frankly, terror. We've bombed hospitals and weddings. We've killed children with drones. If those are the only responses we can muster to terrorism, we will create generation after generation of people who want to strike back. That doesn't make us responsible for attacks against us; only those who carry them out bear that responsibility. Our responsibility is to be better than the terrorists, and to show those who might be seduced by their hatred that the world isn't narrow and ugly. Closing off our borders to terrorized refugees sends exactly the wrong message.

 Refugee restrictions reduce counter-terrorism cooperation and intelligence
sharing, destabilize vital allies, and make terrorist recruiting more effective Acer, 17 - director of Human Rights First’s Refugee Protection program (Eleanor, “U.S. Leadership Forsaken Six Months
of the Trump Refugee Bans” July, Human Rights First, https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/HRF-US- Leadership-Forsaken-FINAL.pdf
President Trump has described his refugee ban orders as necessary to protect the country from security threats. However, refugees are already more rigorously vetted than any other population of travelers to the United States, a point that has been confirmed again and again by former U.S. national security and intelligence officials and former military leaders who have served both Democratic and Republican administrations. 81 Refugees are interviewed repeatedly by trained Department of Homeland Security officers and vetted as well by national intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense and by INTERPOL, a process that includes intelligence from foreign intelligence agencies as well. Their fingerprints and other biometric data are checked against terrorist and criminal databases.82 Any necessary enhancements can and should, as former intelligence and national security officials have pointed out, be implemented without halting the program. The Trump refugee bans are not only unnecessary to safeguard U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, but have actually damaged our foreign policy and national security interests as well as U.S. global leadership. As detailed above, the refugee bans and their cuts to resettlement have impacted U.S. allies and undercut U.S. support for nations whose stability is key to U.S. foreign policy and national security interests. For example, refugee resettlement from Jordan fell by 64 percent in the first five months of 2017 and resettlement from Lebanon fell by 35 percent. Resettlement to the United States from Turkey has dropped by 79 percent in recent months. Former national security officials and military leaders who have served both Democratic and Republican administrations have repeatedly expressed concerns that the derailment of resettlement undermines our ability to support the stability of strategically important nations, including U.S. allies.83 For example: n In the wake of the March 6 order, former officials with national security expertise wrote that “resettlement initiatives advance U.S. national security interests by protecting the stability of U.S. allies and partners struggling to host large numbers of refugees,” that the ban is “harmful to U.S. national security” and that “the order’s drastic reduction in the number of refugees to be resettled ... weakens this country’s ability to provide global leadership and jeopardizes our national security interests by failing to support the stability of our allies that are struggling to host large numbers of refugees.”84 n These concerns have been raised repeatedly over the last year and half. For example, Former CIA Director Hayden and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis wrote last year in the Miami Herald, “The global refugee crisis is straining the resources and infrastructures of Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey, which are hosting the vast majority of Syrian refugees. By doing more to host and help refugees, the United States would safeguard the stability of these nations and thereby advance its own national security interests.” In a letter sent to Congress in December 2015, former national security and military leaders, including former CIA Directors General David Petraeus and General Michael V. Hayden; former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff; former Secretaries of Defense William S. Cohen, William J. Perry, Chuck Hagel, and Leon Panetta; former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; and former National Security Advisors Stephen Hadley and General James L. Jones, wrote that accepting refugees “support[s] the stability of our allies and partners that are struggling to host large numbers of refugees,” and warned that restricting acceptance of refugees would “undermine our core objective of combating terrorism.”85 The cuts, suspension, and derailment of U.S. resettlement instigated by the executive orders, along with their targeting of Syrian and Muslim refugees and travelers, has harmed national security interests in other ways as well. Some former national security, intelligence and military officials have reported that the orders are damaging counter- terrorism cooperation and related intelligence sharing: n In a January 30, 2017 letter, former officials, diplomats, military leaders, and intelligence professionals who served in both the G.W. Bush and Obama Administrations wrote that the January 27 order “will harm our national security” and reported that “Partner countries in Europe and the Middle East, on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism cooperation, are already objecting to this action and distancing themselves from the United States, shredding years of effort to bring them close to us.”86 n In early February 2017, a group of former officials with national security expertise concluded that the January 27 order “will disrupt key counterterrorism, foreign policy, and national security partnerships that are critical to our obtaining the necessary information sharing and
                  161

 collaboration in intelligence, law enforcement, military and diplomatic channels to address the threat posed by terrorist groups such as ISIL.” They reported that the executive order “has alienated U.S. allies” and concluded that the order “will strain our relationship with partner countries in Europe and the Middle East, on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism cooperation, undermining years of effort to bring them closer.” 87 n In March 2017, following the March 6 order, a group of former officials with national security expertise who had worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations concluded that “the revised executive order will jeopardize our relationships with allies and partners on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism operation and informationsharing.”88 n In April 2017, a group of former officials reported that the March 6 order would disrupt national security partnerships critical to addressing the ISIL threat and in particular that the order had already “alienated allies and partners” and that “[c]ountries in the Middle East expressed disapproval and even threatened and engaged in reciprocity in response to the January 27 Order, jeopardizing years of diplomatic outreach.”89 Former U.S. national security and intelligence officials have also concluded that the executive orders undermine U.S. national security by feeding into ISIS’s narratives: n The January 27 order “has already sent exactly the wrong message to the Muslim community here at home and all over the world: that the U.S. government is at war with them based on their religion. We may even endanger Christian communities, by handing ISIL a recruiting tool and propaganda victory that spreads their horrific message the United States is engaged in a religious war.”90 n The January 27 order “will aid ISIL’s propaganda effort and serve its recruitment message by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam.”91 n The bipartisan group of former officials who wrote to President Trump in March 2017 explained that “To Muslims—including those victimized by or fighting against ISIS—it [the March 6 revised executive order] will send a message that reinforces the propaganda of ISIS and other extremist groups that falsely claim the United States is at war with Islam. Welcoming Muslim refugees and travelers, by contrast exposes the lies of terrorists and counters their warped visions.” n A group of former government officials pointed out that “less than a day after President Trump signed the January 27 Order, jihadist groups began citing its contents in recruiting messages online.”92 Former military leaders, veterans, and former national security officials have detailed concerns that the refugee bans, and the resulting cuts and further delays in resettlement, will endanger U.S. troops in the field: n In early February 2017, a group of former officials with national security expertise concluded that the January 27 order “could do long-term damage to our national security and foreign policy interests” and “endanger U.S. troops in the field.” n In April 2017 a group of former officials stated that the order “will endanger troops in the field.” Pointing to the refugee ban’s impact on the resettlement of interpreters and others who have assisted U.S. troops at great risk to their lives, the former officials concluded that “[b]y discouraging future assistance and cooperation from these and other affected military allies and partners, the Order will jeopardize the safety and effectiveness of our Service Members.”93 n Veterans themselves have explained that the refugee ban harms U.S. national security by abandoning the interpreters the military relies on to successfully carry out its missions around the world, stressing that “our mission, and sometimes our lives, depended on the interpreters, translators, and other local allies.”94 Conclusion In a Statement on America’s Commitment to Refugees, released on World Refugee Day in 2016, a group of former officials and retired military leaders—who had served under both Democratic and Republican administrations— joined together to emphasize this country’s strong commitment to protecting the persecuted: For more than two centuries, the idea of America has pulled toward our shores those seeking liberty, and it has ensured that they arrive in the open arms of our citizens. That is why the Statue of Liberty welcomes the world’s ‘huddled masses yearning to breathe free,’ and why President Reagan stressed the United States as ‘a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness.’ The statement’s signatories included: Former Secretary of Defense and U.S. Senator William S. Cohen; Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel; Former Director of the CIA General Michael V. Hayden, U.S. Air Force (Ret.); Former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Michael E. Leiter; Former U.S. Senator Carl M. Levin; Former Commander of U.S. Army Europe General David M. Maddox, U.S. Army (Ret.); Former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matthew G. Olsen; Former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry; Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Admiral James G. Stavridis, U.S. Navy (Ret.); Former Homeland Security Advisor Frances F. Townsend; and, Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. The damage done by President Trump’s refugee bans has been devastating to refugees, to refugee-hosting nations, to American allies and partners, to U.S. national security interests and to U.S. global leadership. The Trump Administration must change course, rescind the bans and launch a renewed and robust effort to lead the world’s nations in assisting, protecting, and resettling refugees. While this country has at times faltered, the U.S.
      162
    
 commitment to protecting the persecuted has deep and strong roots. By restoring America’s role as a beacon to those searching for freedom, this country will not only safeguard its own national security and foreign policy interests, it will demonstrate that its guiding ideals are powerful and at the heart of what makes this nation strong. As U.S. Army veteran Adam Babiker, a former refugee who fled the genocide in Darfur, recently wrote: “We are a beacon, a force for good, and a symbol to the rest of the world. We help the oppressed and welcome the victims of war.”95

 Refugees extensively vetted

The Administration additionally overstates the potential threat posed by refugees resettled in the United States. Refugees are already among the most extensively vetted individuals to enter the United States and alleged security concerns are no reason to cap the USRAP. These baseless justifications must be countered with policies that will preserve the United States' moral integrity and humanitarian tradition.

Among all travelers to the United States, refugees are the most carefully and thoroughly vetted.[15] Prior to traveling, refugees must clear extensive biometric, biographic, intelligence, medical, and law enforcement checks, involving multiple agencies and extensive interviews.[16] While we must continue to screen refugee applicants thoroughly, we must also conduct the vetting and interviews in a timelier manner and address the root causes of mass displacement abroad.

 Refugee cap is a threat to US security
International Human Rights Organization has issued the following news release, August 7, 2018, , Proposed Refugee Cap Threatens U.S National Security, https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/blog/proposed-refugee-cap-threatens-us-national- security
A new report suggests the Trump Administration plans to decrease the number of admitted refugees to 25,000 or lower for fiscal year 2019--a historic low. This move would be a betrayal of the United States' historic legacy on refugee protection and would send the wrong signal to U.S allies and other states who are already hosting the majority of the world's refugees. The reported decrease would also further destabilize refugee-hosting regions and threaten the United States' national security.
The United Nations Refugee Agency reports that 68.5 million people were displaced from their homes last year. Over half are under the age of 18. Another U.N report predicts that the number of refugees who need to be resettled will increase by 17% in 2019. With record numbers of refugees throughout the world, the United States should be increasing its resettlement quota--not lowering it.
A refugee admissions cap of 25,000 would be remarkably low given the fact that the world is currently facing the largest refugee crisis since WWII. If the United States doubled its proposed refugee resettlement cap, and included the asylum backlog numbers, the United States would have around 1 refugee per 1,000 inhabitants. This pales in comparison to front- line countries like Lebanon, which hosts 164 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants.
This drastic reduction in U.S resettlement may encourage other countries to do the same. Front-line countries--such as Pakistan, Turkey, and Uganda--already host over one million refugees each. And we know that large refugee populations can be taxing on countries with limited capacity. Jordan, for example, recently shut their borders to Syrian refugees due to a lack of help or support from the international community. The United States should relieve the undue burden of front- line countries by increasing its commitment to resettling refugees.
An increased refugee cap would help stabilize developing, front-line countries and improve U.S national security interests. Last year, Human Rights First released an analysis on the negative implications that low refugee admissions have on U.S foreign policy. Additionally, former CIA directors, national security advisers, and secretaries of defense, state, and homeland security have explained that resettling refugees advances U.S national security interests. Former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden, for example, stated that halting the U.S refugee program is "dangerous" to the national security interests of the United States.
The Trump Administration cited "enormous security challenges" in justifying their attempt to end the refugee resettlement program. The United States' refugee vetting procedures, however, include extensive and comprehensive interviews as well as multiple rounds of security vetting with a wide array of U.S and international intelligence and law enforcement agencies. They are widely recognized as the most stringent in the world by former U.S military leaders and former U.S national security officials, who have served both Democratic and Republican administrations.
The administration also falsely justifies the decrease in refugee resettlement by arguing that the United States has a large backlog of asylum cases. While a lengthy backlog negatively impacts asylum seekers, the Asylum Division--which handles the backlog--is entirely separate from the Refugee Corps. One program need not come at the expense of the other.
Rather than rob resources from the Refugee Corps, the Trump Administration should properly fund and staff both the Refugee Corps and the Asylum Division. This would include hiring officers capable of addressing the asylum backlog for which funds are already allocated. Additionally, since the asylum backlog has been exacerbated by the Trump Administration's decision to send Asylum Division personnel to the border-- and away from parts of the country with the greatest need for these resources--the White House is now in a position to point at the mess it helped create as justification for limiting refugee admissions.
166
 
 This reported drastic cut to refugee admissions is unjustifiable. Higher refugee admissions would improve relations between the United States and front-line countries and improve our nation's safety and security. The Trump Administration must set the refugee admissions cap at a number that reflects the world refugee crisis.
167

 Turn – reducing refugees makes it difficult to get translators to cooperate in the
war on terrorism
Reihan Salman, September 7, 2018, A Better Way to Absorb Refugees, https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/the-future-of-the-refugee-act/569359/
But Trump's efforts to scale back refugee resettlement raise larger questions about the future of the program, and about humanitarian immigration more broadly. Providing tens of thousands of forced migrants with new lives in the U.S. has both a symbolic and strategic purpose. The strategic case for refugee resettlement is straightforward. Military officials have warned that by greatly reducing the resettlement of Iraqi refugees, the Trump administration has made it harder to secure the cooperation of local translators and other personnel in conflict zones. The promise of refugee status is, in other words, a powerful inducement for convincing Iraqis to put their lives at risk. One suspects future presidents will be more receptive to this national-security rationale than Trump, who has been notably skeptical of nation-building efforts.

 Turn - Accepting refugees improves relations with other countries that take
them
Reihan Salman, September 7, 2018 , A Better Way to Absorb Refugees, https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/the-future-of-the-refugee-act/569359/
As for the symbolic dimension, consider that the vast majority of the world's refugees are found in the developing world, in countries immediately adjacent to unfolding crises, as Alexander Betts and Paul Collier observe in their 2017 book Refuge. By accepting a token number of refugees from host countries experiencing far larger inflows, the U.S. and other rich, market democracies demonstrate solidarity with the states bearing the heaviest burdens. The value of symbolism notwithstanding, states that shelter vast numbers of refugees might prefer increases in aid or trade concessions over the resettlement of a small fraction of those they've admitted, which is why some contrarian voices, Betts and Collier included, have called on the rich world to devote substantially more resources to supporting these states of refuge.

Some will argue that accepting more refugees will hurt the economy, but there are many reasons that increasing the acceptance of refugees will improve economies

 Refugees will boost economic growth in the US
Sasha Chanoff, USA Today, September 7, 2018, Bring more refugees to America. They'll fill vacant jobs and boost our economy, https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/07/trump-resettle-more-refugees-fill-jobs-boost-economy- column/1131898002/
With unemployment hovering at record lows, there are hundreds of thousands of jobs available in health care, service, manufacturing, construction and other industries that Americans alone can't fill. "Never before have we had an economy where the number of open jobs exceeds the number of job seekers," Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said. The 3.2 million refugees who have come to our shores since the refugee resettlement program started in 1980 make up an important part of the American workforce. And more could do so if we let them in. But the Trump administration is decimating U.S. resettlement -- by reducing slots to historic lows and chopping the legs out from under the program. This year we will see the lowest resettlement numbers in our history, perhaps 20,000 compared to an average of 95,000 annually. And the administration may shrink the official cap even more for 2019. U.S. businesses want to hire refugees With an unprecedented 25 million refugees living in exile for an average of 20 years before going home, the decimation of U.S. resettlement is a tragic abdication of global leadership. It also leaves many jobs unfilled and many industries hurting. Meat packing plants and lumber mills that rely on refugee employees need many more. Manufacturing and other industries across the country are looking to hire refugees. I used to help refugees find work in the U.S. They often took jobs that Americans didn't want. What I heard from employers then -- that refugees were dependable, dedicated, fast learners and long-stayers -- has now been captured in a new nonpartisan report, Refugees as Employees: Good Retention, Strong Recruitment. It found that turnover rates were up to two thirds lower for refugees than for employees overall, and that when a few refugees succeed, it's easy to recruit many more. That's not surprising. The experience of losing your home and having your life shattered lights a fierce and unique kind of fire to regain control and reestablish yourself. More: I was a 'lost boy' of Sudan and the US welcomed me. More refugees deserve that chance. Syrian refugees like me don't want to depend on government. We want to contribute to society. World Refugee Day: Please don't make it just another day This is perhaps why refugees are so entrepreneurial. In cities like Lewiston, Maine and St. Louis, Missouri, once depressed downtown areas are now flourishing thanks to refugees who saw opportunities and started businesses in the shuttered shops and buildings on main streets. A PBS News Hour report highlights that Utica, New York's commitment to resettling refugees is "a pioneering economic tool for revitalizing the Rust Belt." A government study found that refugees contribute $63 billion more to the U.S. economy over 10 years than they take in services. Refugees everywhere want to contribute. A new refugee Talent Catalogue with more than 10,000 profiles in the Middle East highlights engineers, accountants, teachers, health care, computer and IT professionals, and others ready to work. Paul Polman, the CEO of Unilever, suggested that the vast Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan could essentially be emptied out to fill labor needs across Europe. Canada sees an opportunity here to connect refugees with jobs in Canadian territories where unemployment hovers below 3 percent in some cases. Working with several organizations including RefugePoint, the group I lead to help the most at-risk refugees, Canada is supplementing its resettlement program with an Economic Mobility Pathway Project aimed at bringing in more refugees. Our economy needs refugees If you just listen to Trump, you'd think we must stop bringing in refugees because they are dangerous. But that's simply false. The Cato Institute estimates that the chance of an American being killed by a refugee terrorist is one in 3.64 billion. Vetting can take up to two years. Many of our country's top Republican security advisers say a robust resettlement program is in our national security interest because it helps stabilize front-line countries hosting the most refugees. (The U.S. ranks 18th among refugee hosting countries.) Our president will determine the 2019 resettlement numbers this month. There are many reasons to increase resettlement: The refugee crisis is unprecedented. Resettlement is lifesaving. It's stabilizing for a world in turmoil. We host relatively few refugees comparatively. Our actions influence other countries. The welcoming ethos is a defining national characteristic. Resettlement is in our national security interest. It doesn't compromise our safety, and has always enjoyed bipartisan support. But perhaps the economic argument is most important today: Resettlement helps fill otherwise un-fillable jobs. It enables companies to find loyal employees who can maximize productivity and profits. Wiping out the U.S. program, as Trump and his far-right adviser Stephen Miller seem intent on doing, is not only counter-productive. It's reckless.

 Canadian refugees do well economically
Postmedia Breaking News, October 8, 2018, Douglas Todd: Refugees earn more than most Canadians after 25 years, https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-refugees-earn-more-than-most-canadians-after-25-years
Refugees who arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s are now earning more than the average Canadian. An internal immigration department document shows that, after 25 years in the country, a typical refugee is earning as much or more than the Canadian norm, which is about $45,000 a year. The document quotes a senior department official who says the long-term study of refugees' wages suggests the recent wave of 50,000 refugees from Syria could several decades from now do as well as earlier refugees( https://vancouversun.com/opinion/douglas-todd-five-things-the-west- can-do-for-the-left-behind ) in regards to earnings. "In a nutshell this is the trajectory we would expect (all things being equal) from government-assisted refugees and privately-sponsored refugees," senior immigration department official Umit Kiziltan writes in a memo obtained under an access to information request. The immigration and tax department data, which tracks refugees' earnings from 1981 to 2014, shows that average government-assisted refugees earned less than $20,000 a year in their first decade in the country, when many families rely on provincial welfare and other government benefits to get by. However, after 25 to 30 years in Canada, the average refugee is earning roughly $50,000 a year, about $5,000 more than the average Canadian. The study also shows the earnings gap between government-assisted refugees, who initially do worse than privately-sponsored refugees, basically disappears over the long run.

In that era the total number of refugees arriving ranged from 15,000 to 40,000 annually. In recent years Canada has accepted more than 50,000 refugees from war-torn Syria alone. Vancouver immigration lawyer Richard Kurland, who obtained the internal government documents, said they contain reliable information that strongly indicate most refugees, no matter where they come from, develop usable skills and do well in the labour market over their careers. However, even though the senior immigration department's memo welcomed the news that refugees who arrived several decades ago perform well, Kiziltan cautioned that it's hard to forecast how more recent refugees will do, given the "cyclical nature of the economy overall and especially (the) human capital of the Syrian cohorts." The report, in addition, also does not compare the earnings of refugees who have been in Canada for several decades (which means many would be in their 50s and at the peak of their careers) with the earnings of other Canadians of the same age cohort. The data on refugees' slow road to labour-market success in Canada comes on the heels of 2018 controversies over thousands of asylum seekers illegally crossing the Canadian border, a Syrian refugee being charged with themurder of Burnaby teenager Marrisa
Shen( https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/police-to-share-significant-update-in-murder-of-burnaby-teen-marrisa- shen ) and a Postmedia story revealing( https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-trudeau-government- goes-silent-on-syrian-refugees ) the federal Liberal government has not produced any report in two years on whether recent Syrian refugees are learning English or French, working, receiving social assistance or going to school. This is not the first federal government indication, however, that many refugees eventually earn solid incomes. In 2014 then-federal Conservative immigration department minister Jason Kenney cancelled the contentious immigrant-investor
program( https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-can-welfare-societies-survive-mass-migration ) while revealing that refugees were actually paying more in Canadian income taxes than wealthy newcomers who had in effect bought their Canadian passports. Asked about the contrast between taxes paid in Canada by refugees and rich immigrants, Kurland said it's "a complicated comparison." The breadwinner of an immigrant-investor family, Kurland explained, "usually returns home to support the family's millionaire lifestyle in Canada" and therefore, unlike a refugee who stays in Canada, doesn't pay significant income taxes in this country. Previous studies have consistently shown that, while adult refugees often struggle in the short to medium term, many of their children quickly perform well in their new land, in large part because they gain extra social support, a taxpayer-funded education in English or French and the time to
         173

 develop skills. This recent internal study of refugee earnings, however, is among the first to emphasize that, over many decades, most of the refugees who had direct experience of war, persecution and trauma in their homeland are capable of attaining financial success in the country that welcomed them.

 Refugees benefit the economy
Congressional Documents and Publications, August 31, 2018 With the Number of Refugees Permitted to Come to the U.S. on Pace for Lowest Number on Record, Senators Call on Trump Administration to Step Up Efforts and Honor America's Legacy as a Safe Haven for Families Fleeing Persecution, https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press- releases/durbin-duckworth-senators-call-on-trump-administration-to-meet-current-refugee-resettlement-cap-and- significantly-increase-numbers-of-refugees-allowed-into-us-
Since our nation's founding, refugees have brought immense value, diversity, and perseverance to the American character. These characteristics have made our country stronger and more resilient. Reports show that refugees are highly entrepreneurial--creating jobs for United States citizens--and generating billions of dollars in economic growth for the United States.[13] Refugees' labor force participation, employment rates, median income, spending power, and rates of college graduation are robust.[14] Not only is the United States' refugee program a moral imperative, but it also is an economic boon to our country.

 Refugees benefit the local economy, they do not hurt it
Center for Global Development , Impact News Service, October 11, 2018 , The Economic and Fiscal Effects of Granting Refugees Formal Labor Market Access, https://www.cgdev.org/publication/economic-and-fiscal-effects-granting- refugees-formal-labor-market-access-brief
Refugees can be immense economic contributors to the host communities where they settle. However, to maximize their contributions and achieve improved well-being and self-reliance, refugees need formal labor market access.[1] But this access is often limited, especially in developing countries. Even where the law allows refugees to access formal employment, administrative and practical barriers often limit this access. One reason refugees have little access to formal employment is the unsubstantiated belief that refugees inevitably drive down wages, take jobs from hosts, and reduce the quality of services.[2] While these fears are understandable because of the complex economic and fiscal effects of hosting refugees, they are, for the most part, not borne out by the evidence.[3] (For a full definition of formal LMA, see Box 1 in the PDF.)
Overall, even short of a comprehensive version of formal LMA, wherein both legal and de facto barriers to access are minimal or nonexistent, greater rights and fewer barriers around work and business ownership enable greater benefits. Furthermore, in many cases, policies restricting access to formal work can exacerbate negative effects rather than mitigate them. For example, restricting refugees to certain geographies and sectors intensifies competition between refugees and hosts, increasing the likelihood of negative effects on wages and employment. Formal LMA allows refugees to be more productive employees and business owners, which leads to a more efficient economy and increased GDP for host countries; new employment opportunities for both hosts and refugees; an increased labor supply, which benefits businesses; higher incomes for refugees and thus greater self-reliance and less dependence on aid; greater consumer spending, which stimulates local markets; and increased tax revenues. Other economic benefits include the possibility of increased trade, innovation, and investment in human capital. For refugees, formal LMA can also mean greater workplace protections, greater security and stability, and decreased rates of child labor and child marriage. Some degree of job competition is real and should be taken seriously. But those effects are more pronounced when the absence of formal LMA crowds refugees into small corners of the informal sector, as appears to have occurred during the first two years of the flood of Syrian refugees into Turkey.[4] Thus formal LMA itself can mitigate labor market impacts on hosts. And complementary policies can mitigate or eliminate the costs to host workers associated with formal LMA for refugees. Those policies, importantly, can also amplify benefits. Examples of these policies include: Allowing refugees complementary rights such as the freedom of movement, which minimizes the concentration of any negative impacts while increasing refugees' productivity by enabling them to find jobs that better match their skills and experience. Supporting hosts displaced from their jobs by helping them find new employment opportunities--including by moving to other regions--and upgrade to higher paying positions. Helping refugees integrate into the labor market, with a focus on supporting women and the most vulnerable groups. Offsetting any short-term increases in spending by the host government with fiscal support from donors. Recognizing formal workplace protections for refugees and vulnerable host populations, which ultimately benefits host workers as well. Recently there has been increased momentum around granting refugees greater formal LMA and complementary rights. In 2016, UN Member States unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Migrants and Refugees, which "[encouraged] host Governments to consider opening their labour markets to refugees."[5] Toward this goal and others, the Declaration laid out plans for a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) which, among other objectives, aims to ease pressure on host countries through increased support while increasing employment opportunities for refugees.[6] This enables and incentivizes host governments to expand formal LMA for refugees even in the face of political challenges. Some developing countries with restricted formal LMA, such as Ethiopia, have already embraced the CRRF as a productive path forward.[7] In this context, new opportunities are emerging: Governments have the chance to unleash the unrealized contributions of refugee populations while also receiving international support, to the benefit of their economies. Civil society organizations have more room than ever to push for greater rights for refugees and implement programs that support self-reliance among refugees and hosts. Businesses can mobilize as advocates for pragmatic policy, and engage refugees as employees and suppliers. If refugees had greater rights, many global and
            176

 regional businesses would be well-positioned to hire and supply from refugees: nearly 40 percent of working-age refugees in developing countries are in major urban areas, where these businesses are most likely to be located.[8] With these new opportunities, there is a growing interest in understanding what the economic and fiscal effects of granting formal LMA to refugees are likely to be. This paper previews these effects, highlighting the potential benefits refugees can generate and the policies

 Refugees help Canada fill labor gaps
Sara Miller Llana Staff writer, Christian Science Monitor, November 18, 2018, In global refugee flow, Canada finds a surprising solution to a labor shortage, https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2018/1116/In-global-refugee- flow-Canada-finds-a-surprising-solution-to-a-labor-shortage
Nagham Abu Issa was working as an executive assistant in a cement factory in Damascus when the civil war started in Syria. Her family fled to Lebanon. But with no job prospects there, her siblings left on the risky passage to Europe. Ms. Abu Issa, the eldest daughter, stayed behind with her mother. She is a refugee. She is also a valuable employee. She has a degree from Damascus University in English literature and has studied human resources. As she worked her way up in her job, she had big dreams - to become a chief operating officer or even start her own company one day. "My communication skills are my strongest asset, both internally and externally," she says in an interview over Skype. Now she hopes to take that savvy to Canada, not through resettlement but to fill the country's labor gaps. She has interviewed with Talent Beyond Boundaries (TBB), an international NGO that has started pilots in Canada and Australia to match a small number of refugees based in Lebanon and Jordan with employment opportunities abroad. The experiment so far is tiny, but it's aiming high: to forge a new pathway for refugees to be recognized for what they can bring to a country, not for the state of the countries they were forced to leave. In so doing, TBB hopes to shift attitudes about refugees among Western nations and their immigration systems, some of which are under assault by the rise of populism and nativism. Bruce Cohen, co- founder of TBB and former chief counsel and staff director for the US Senate Judiciary Committee, says that when they began at the height of the refugee crisis in Europe in 2014 and 2015, he was often told there were no talented refugees left. So his group created a searchable database for displaced jobseekers in Lebanon and Jordan that today holds more than 11,000 resumes. "Everyone from engineers to nurses, and also the skilled trades, carpenters, welders, plumbers, butchers, chefs, you name it, it probably is represented in the refugee community," he says. "It is really getting rid of this image of refugees as unskilled, poor, pitiful." Building support systems Their effort comes amid a much larger conversation about adapting the global refugee system, built after World War II, to the realities of long-term conflict. In 2017, 68.5 million people were forced to leave their homes, with 25.4 million becoming refugees outside their home countries. The vast majority are in countries that border conflict, such as Jordan, Lebanon, or Turkey. The global system currently envisions that refugees will voluntarily return when conflict ends, integrate where they first land, or be resettled elsewhere, an option limited to the most vulnerable. By the end of the year, United Nations members are expected to endorse the Global Compact on Refugees, an international agreement that envisions more solidarity between countries hosting the majority of refugees on issues like resettlement and other pathways to third countries, which is where a program such as TBB would fit. The group is not alone in grappling with how to put refugees to work. In the United States, the Tent Partnership for Refugees works with businesses to facilitate refugee hires, both in countries to which they first flee and where they are ultimately resettled. Tent Partnership's leaders argue that it is not just the right thing to do, it makes both strategic and business sense. A report released by Tent and the Fiscal Policy Institute in May, for example, showed higher retention rates and resilience among the refugee workforce in the US market. "Our key principle is that businesses can and should be doing more to support refugees," says Gideon Maltz, the executive director of Tent Partnership for Refugees, who supports the TBB model as an additional option. In Canada jobs are plentiful. The government recently announced it will take in 350,000 immigrants in 2021, or 40,000 more than it expects to admit this year. Canadian employers have also expressed interest in hiring refugees. The Fairmont Chateau Whistler in British Columbia is just one example. The hotel offered jobs and housing to 12 refugees overseas who are now in the process of entering Canada as privately sponsored refugees. Four have already arrived. "The limitation is not on the jobs," says Laurie Cooper, a private sponsor who helped facilitate the arrangement. She says she wishes the process were faster. That is where TBB is attempting to make a difference, though their work is slow too, as they attempt to create a new pathway. In Canada, TBB has so far only secured 7 formal offers. The program works with federal and provincial governments on visas and connects employers to refugee talent. It helps businesses overcome legal barriers refugees face that traditional economic migrants would not, such as a lack of178 passports or access to education records. Creative solutions for the refugee system Susan Fratzke, policy analyst at the
                   
 Migration Policy Institute, says TBB could scale up in Canada or Australia because of their robust economic migration systems. And other countries may look to economic migration for refugees as a model. "If you look at conversations about resettlement or asylum in Europe, there is a lot of concern about how people will be integrated, how they will find jobs," Ms. Fratzke says. "If you are providing a pathway for people coming with an offer of work, that addresses some of those issues." Abu Issa says that one of her brothers, now a refugee in Sweden, applied for family reunification, but the claim was rejected. So she and her mother are still in Lebanon, more than five years after they first arrived, where work has been precarious and sexual harassment a constant concern. She has been in contact with international organizations that offer refugees the chance to study. "But I'm not a student. I'm a graduate," she says. "My dream is to move with a job, to prove myself because of my work." Labor pathways for refugees have faced criticism by those who see it as a neoliberal overlay onto the refugee system. Mr. Cohen, the TBB co-founder, says it is meant to complement the current system, not take away from it. It is designed to reach skilled refugees who aren't "vulnerable enough" to qualify for resettlement, he says. "[This program] is to say you can move based on your skills and abilities," he says. "You move to a job that benefits from your skills. And that is a way back to self-reliance." Heather Segal, founder of Segal Immigration Law in Toronto, is working pro-bono with TBB because she says too many skilled refugees stagnate while nations like Canada face labor shortages. "Why are we obviating a group of educated, skilled people because their country fell apart?" she says. "There is a gap here that needs to be addressed.... We need creative solutions for the refugee system in the 21st century."

 That’s still thousands of lives
Gillman Friedman, Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City), July 20, 2018 Friday, Refugees in U.S. drop
sharply
But he says the symbolic value of America's actions carries more weight. "We were once seen as a country that honored freedom and fought for those who were persecuted," says Allen. At a time when a record number of refugees are in need of safe homes, "it's notable that instead of ramping up our efforts, we are actually retrenching. It speaks to a larger positioning of America as one of shirking from leadership on this issue rather than embracing it." Darrow says the effect of the Trump administration's policies on refugee resettlement could have far-reaching consequences, not only for refugees fleeing persecution but for the resettlement agencies that support newly arriving refugees. A resulting lack of funding may force some agencies to lay off staff or shut down. Erol Kekic, senior vice president of the Immigration and Refugee Program of the Church World Service, explains the number of refugees resettled in America will continue to decline this year. He says that while Trump capped the number of refugees at 45,000 for fiscal year 2018, political and bureaucratic issues will cap the number of refugees resettled in the United States at a projected number of just 20,000 to 25,000 refugees resettled. "If and when we do not reach the target of 45,000, that means we have failed to save over 20,000 lives this year alone, and we chose to do that," he says. "That's a hard fact to swallow for me."

No international instrument defines ‘asylum’. Article 14 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights simply says that ‘Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.’ Article 1 of the 1967 UN Declaration on Territorial Asylum notes that ‘Asylum granted by a State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, to persons entitled to invoke Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights...shall be respected by all other States.’ But it is for ‘the State granting asylum to evaluate the grounds for the grant of asylum’ (Goodwin-Gill 2012). Neither instrument creates any binding obligations for states. Indeed, both texts suggest a considerable margin of appreciation with respect to who is granted asylum and what exactly this means. In practice, however, states’ freedom of action is significantly influenced by ‘external’ constraints, which follow from an internationally recognized refugee definition, the application of the principle of non-refoulement, and the overall impact of human rights law. Regional instruments and doctrine have also had an important impact on the ‘asylum question’. Again, the 1969 OAU Convention was among the first to give a measure of normative content to the discretionary competence of states to grant asylum (Article II).17 Within the EU, the 2000 Charter of Fundamental Rights declares expressly that ‘the right to asylum shall be guaranteed...’, and that no one may be removed to a state where he or she faces a serious risk of the death penalty, torture, or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Articles 18, 19). The Qualification Directive provides in turn that member states ‘shall grant’ refugee status to those who satisfy the relevant criteria (Article 13; see also Article 8 of the Temporary Protection Directive) (Gil-Bazo 2008).

Local integration, that is, residence and acceptance into the local community where the refugee first arrives, is the practical realization of asylum. States may be bound to the refugee definition and bound to observe the principle of non-refoulement, but they retain discretion as to whether to allow a refugee to settle locally; this point was underlined by the UNHCR Executive Committee in its 2005 Conclusion on local integration,20 although with little if any regard or reference to states’ other obligations under international law which govern the treatment of non- nationals on state territory.

 Overwhelming alt causes to international law violations
Norchi, 17 - Charles H. Norchi is Professor of Law and University Trustee Professor in the University of Maine School of Law, USA, and a contributing editor to Global Geneva (“Trump’s Impact on International Law: A Great unravelling?” 3/14, http://www.global-geneva.com/trumps-impact-on-international-law-a-great-unravelling/
Sanctuary Cities, Federal agents, raids, aliens, poitical cartoon Two months into the new United States administration, US President Donald Trump has already had an impact on international law, and the international legal system that now appears on the brink of unravelling. Executive Orders intended to modify or withdraw from legal obligations by the US government will affect the United Nations, human rights, refugees, international trade, the environment and limitations on the use of force. US law classifies international agreements according to three basic categories: treaties, congressional executive agreements and sole executive agreements. In most circumstances, the President can withdraw unilaterally from sole executive agreements (i.e. political arrangements). The December, 2015 UN-sponsored Paris Agreement on climate change falls into this category. As a result, Trump’s proposed policies could significantly undermine much of the progress made in recent years with regard to environmental protection. Three of Trump’s executive orders have a bearing on immigration and human rights and they impose dramatic restrictions on asylum and other immigration protections in the United States. These breach the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Border Enforcement Order violates 1951 Refugee Convention The 1951 Refugee Convention, for example, obliges governments to observe the principle of non- refoulement. It prohibits parties from expelling or returning refugees to territories where their lives or freedom would be at risk. The Border Enforcement Order violates this agreement by directing the Department of Homeland (DHS) to expand “expedited removal” to the maximum extent possible. This executive order alone threatens the lives of up to 11 million illegal immigrants. It will exponentially increase the likelihood of refoulement. The criminal penalties under the new policies violate international law and fail to protect basic refugee rights. The Refugee Convention also prohibits the imposition of penalties on refugees for unauthorized entry or presence in a country. Trump’s policy of prosecuting and penalizing undocumented entrants without consideration for why they fled is a breach of the international obligations of the United States. International trade agreements and the global trade system have also been put at risk. Trump intends to terminate agreements pertaining to international commerce and trade, beginning with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). President Obama signed the TPP, but the agreement required Congressional approval, was never debated and consequently never entered into force. Trump’s “un-signing” the TPP— the largest regional trade accord in history—as a matter of unilateral Executive power was straightforward. It went ‘puff” with the stroke of a pen. Other countries to fill global economy vacuum NAFTA, in theory, requires six-months notice before any of the partners can withdraw. Nevertheless, it was implemented by congressional-executive agreement, and it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to withdraw without the support of Congress. However,since Trump is a Republican and Republicans control both houses of Congress, it is a moot point. What is clear is that if the U.S. retreats from the global economy, other countries will fill the vacuum, notably China. Trump has also suggested that the US could withdraw from the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO treaties were congressional-executive agreements approved and implemented by Congress. Withdrawal would require consent from both houses of Congress as well as the president. There is no question that a withdrawal would significantly affect the ability of American companies to access foreign markets. It would also make them vulnerable to customs, duties, tariffs and regulatory barriers. In addition, American firms would no longer be able to challenge expropriations and other commercially discriminatory actions before international tribunals. Global trade and commerce would become much more unpredictable. International markets are already beginning to show signs of instability. Increased risk of international confrontation The most important function of international law is the prevention of war. The Iran Nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was concluded by the United States, the EU and five other countries precisely to ensure that Iran could not build a nuclear weapon. The intention was to avoid war, especially with Israel. Trump has called the JCPOA “the worst deal ever negotiated,” and declared that ending it would be his “number one priority.” The JCPOA is a political commitment that turns on technical—and thus far successful—verification measures. US denunciation of the JCPOA 186 would not only risk an international confrontation, it would also be harmful to Western companies seeking to do business
            
 in Iran and to the legal regime for the control of nuclear weapons. It would send a dangerous signal to paranoid elites who control nuclear weapons. The Trump Administration will most likely attempt to undercut more ratified treaties which impose international legal obligations on the United States. The US Supreme Court has not settled the question of whether the President can unilaterally withdraw from treaties or congressional executive agreements. However, whether any state can withdraw from, denounce or terminate a treaty is not merely a domestic matter. It is also a matter of international law which requires either compliance with a specific withdrawal procedure or narrow exceptions. Under the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a state may only withdraw from or otherwise terminate its obligations if the treaty itself permits, or with the consent of all parties. Without such clauses, which can vary widely with many specifying a fixed term of years and/or notice period, the treaty is presumed to continue indefinitely. Failure to comply with the Vienna Convention procedures means that a US withdrawal would not be considered legal by the international community. Undermining predictability in an otherwise anarchical international system Flouting international law has consequences and risks blowback. It encourages similar behavior by other countries, often powerful ones. If the US government breaches the 1951 Refugee Convention, other states are also likely to suspend the Convention. In the first months of the Trump Administration, for example, Russia violated the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) by a missile deployment. A Russian surveillance vessel sits in waters 30 nautical miles from the east coast of the U.S., and the Kremlin continues to breach the UN Charter by annexation of Crimea. Strongmen in Turkey suppress expression and in the Philippines execute citizens extra-judicially; China re-asserts aggressive maritime claims, and North Korea threatens nuclear war. A principle goal of international law is to ensure a measure of predictability in an otherwise anarchical international system. Presidential pronouncements, signals and tweets can erode the international legal system because they may be taken as authoritative. And as exclusive self-interests displace inclusive common interests, the public order of the world community degrades. If Trump succeeds in his stated objectives, we will see the waning of a 70-year international order (built on the ashes of World War II) which enshrined respect for law. If Trump succeeds in his stated objectives, we will see the waning of a post-war liberal world order that was built on international law. Will it unravel in the age of Trump?

 US violations of international refugee law occur all the time – empirically denies the impact
Coen, 18 - Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin Sheboygan (Alise, “International order, the rule of law, and US departures from refugee protection”, The International Journal of Human Rights, 4/24, https://doi.org/10.1080/13642987.2018.1454910)//AK
US departures from refugee protection principles
In ratifying the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, the United States bound itself to the international refugee regime and to the protections enshrined in Articles 2 through 34 of the Refugee Convention. These include the definition of a refugee, the treatment of refugees and the prohibition on returning persons to destinations where they might face harm or persecution (i.e. non-refoulement).46 The Refugee Act of 1980 was intended to bring US asylum policy in line with international legal standards. However, both policymakers and the courts have enabled US refugee policy to violate international norms even when international standards are clear and peremptory.47 One prominent example of US manoeuvring to circumvent non-refoulement includes the interception of boats of Haitian asylum-seekers in the early 1990s to prevent them from arriving directly on US territory. Over 65,000 individuals were interdicted and immediately returned to Haiti by the US Coast Guard without any evaluation of asylum claims.48 The US Supreme Court and members of Congress upheld the validity of the Haitian interdiction programme in 1993, interpreting the prohibition on non-refoulement to apply only to refugees already within the territorial borders of contracting states.49 This interpretation was substantially at odds with international standards and stands out as an early US departure from refugee protection norms in the post-Cold War environment. It is noteworthy that the violation of non-refoulement vis-à-vis Haitian asylum- seekers occurred amidst a growing nativist wave in US politics framing the influx of Mexican, Latino, Haitian and other migrants of colour within discourses of ‘invasion’, ‘hyperfertility’, ‘criminals’ and ‘welfare-takers’. 50 This suggests an important connection between international human rights norm violations and domestic erosions of non-discrimination principles intrinsic to the democratic rule of law. Violations of basic human rights and international refugee law have repeatedly manifested in the US treatment of asylum-seekers along its southern border. These include evidence of long and arbitrary periods of detention, pressures to withdraw asylum claims, and lack of access to due process and legal representation rights.51 The UNHCR’s 2016 report expressed particular concern over the continued US detention of vulnerable groups such as child asylum-seekers, the lack of access to legal advice for detained asylum-seekers, and contracts with private prison corporations and local jails that result in asylum-seekers in the United States being detained in the same locations and conditions as suspected or convicted criminals.52 Such treatment violates important international human rights standards, including protections against detention and restrictions on the freedom of movement under the CAT, the ICCPR, the Refugee Convention and regional instruments.53 The Refugee Convention, for example, requires states to treat asylum-seekers as presumptive refugees, affording them the right to freedom of movement and avoiding their detention unless exceptional circumstances necessitate it according to a narrow set of objectives.54 Moreover, ‘protection is owed to a person meeting the definition (whether or not status has been formally assessed) who is under a State party’s jurisdiction ... and immigration penalties may not be imposed for unlawful entry or presence dictated by flight from persecution’. 55 Despite extreme conditions of human tragedy characterising the threats faced by asylum-seekers from Central America,56 these groups have been politicised and securitised along with asylum-seekers from Mexico through the prism of an ‘illegal immigration crisis’ in US politics. Nativist narratives emphasising an ‘immigration invasion’ 57 have provided local-level justifications for violating international human rights law and resonate within a long history of casting black and Latino identity outside the parameters of American national belonging, as ‘unfit neighbours and suspect citizens’. 58 Elements of nativism and racial discrimination at work in both the Haitian interdiction programme and the internment and deportation of asylum-seekers along the southern US border raise concerns for the democratic rule of law. Nondiscrimination and equality are salient values in liberal democracies and essential elements underpinning the rule of law.59 Moreover, protecting the rights, equality and dignity not only of citizens but also of foreigners is integral to a truly democratic rule of law.60 US behaviour in this area has violated important human rights norms regarding noninternment and non-discrimination, whereby ‘one ought not to be subjected
                       188

 to detention without charge or trial on the basis of ascribed or acquired characteristics (such as race, religion, or nationality)’. 61 Concerns regarding US violations of non-discrimination in the treatment of asylum-seekers have intensified since the September 11 attacks. Studies show an increase in the denial of asylum claims for individuals from Arabic-speaking countries and evidence of growing discrimination based on language heritage skills among both US asylum officers and immigration judges.62 A significant departure from non-discrimination principles occurred with the commencement of Operation Liberty Shield in 2003, a programme initiated within the US Department of Homeland Security. In addition to heightening security measures at borders and airports, the programme modified asylum procedures by requiring the detention of asylum-seekers from over 30 countries where ‘al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda sympathizers, and other terrorist groups are known to have operated’. 63 The initiative mandated that even asylum-seekers who raised no security suspicions be detained for the duration of their asylum proceedings – typically lasting well over six months – on the basis of their national origin.64 Departures from refugee protection principles continued with the Real ID Act, passed by the US Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2005. Its changes to the asylum process were framed in terms of protecting Americans from the threat of terrorists seeking entry by posing as refugees or asylum-seekers. This legislation amended the US Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) to add new requirements to the burden of proof placed on asylum applicants, including requiring proof that one of the statutory grounds for refugee status (race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion) was the central motive for persecution rather than one of several mixed motives. The legislation also allowed for the denial of a petition for asylum if even minor inaccuracies were found in an asylum-seeker’s statements, regardless of whether the inconsistencies were centrally relevant to the applicant’s claim.65

 AT: Moral Claims
Pro teams need to make strong arguments against the Con’s claim that there is a moral obligation to provide a safe haven for refugees.

 States have an obligation to protect the rights of their own citizens, not the rights of other citizens.
Michael Blake, Philosopher, 2003, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Volume 41, Issue 2, Immigration, Jurisdiction, and Exclusion, pages 103–130, Spring 2013
What I want to emphasize, in this context, is that, while the first demand is universal, the second two are emphatically local. The state is under a universal demand to avoid violating human rights, that is, whether the violation occurs within its jurisdiction or not. But the state is under no correspondingly universal obligation to protect or fulfill the rights of humans qua humans. The state is instead obliged to protect and fulfill the rights of only some humans, namely, those who happen to be present within its territorial jurisdiction. This limitation does not seem by itself to run up against the liberal demand for the equality of persons; it is instead the means by which that equality is to be made operational in a world of territorial states. Thus, an assault in France upon a French citizen is undoubtedly a violation of human rights, and is undoubtedly to be regretted by all states, French or otherwise. But the United States is not obliged to devote its institutional capacity to the vindication of the rights of the French citizen to be free from assault. (Indeed, it would likely strike the French government as rather problematic if the Americans began to build institutions devoted to the punishment of French rights-violators.) The United States is able to devote its own institutional capacity to the protection and fulfillment of the rights of those present on American soil. It does this not because it values French lives less than American lives; after all, it would—if it were just—devote just as much time and effort to an assault upon a French tourist as to an assault upon an American citizen. It is able to devote its own institutional capacity in this way because of the jurisdictional limitation of the United States government, which is authorized and obligated to protect and fulfill human rights only within a particular part of the world's surface.18 Those who participate in the American system, further, are authorized and obligated to help support this system's ability to protect and fulfill human rights in this way. If we believe—as I do—that we have as individuals a general duty to uphold just institutions, then those who live and work within the jurisdiction of the United States have an obligation that is both legal and moral to protect and fulfill the human rights of their (jurisdictional) neighbors.19

 The only moral responsibility we have in foreign policy is to avoid harm.
George Kennan, Director of the State Department’s Policy Planning Staff, Ambassador to the USSR and Yugoslavia, Professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies 1986 Foreign Affairs Winter 85-
86, http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/price/373/kennan.pdf DOA: 9-30-15
In a less than perfect world, where the ideal so obviously lies beyond human reach, it is natural that the avoidance of the worst should often be a more practical undertaking than the achievement of the best, and that some of the strongest imperatives of moral conduct should be ones of a negative rather than a positive nature. The strictures of the Ten Commandments are perhaps the best illustration of this state of affairs. This being the case, it is not surprising that some of the most significant possibilities for the observance of moral considerations in American foreign policy relate to the avoidance of actions that have a negative moral significance, rather than to those from which positive results are to be expected. Many of these possibilities lie in the intuitive qualities of diplomacy -- such things as the methodology, manners, style, restraint and elevation of diplomatic discourse -- and they can be illustrated only on the basis of a multitude of minor practical examples, for which this article is not the place. There are, however, two negative considerations that deserve mention here. The first of these relates to the avoidance of what might be called the histrionics of moralism at the expense of its substance. By that is meant the projection of attitudes, poses and rhetoric that cause us to appear noble and altruistic in the mirror of our own vanity but lack substance when related to the realities of international life. It is a sad feature of the human predicament, in personal as in public life, that whenever one has the agreeable sensation of being impressively moral, one probably is not. What one does without self-consciousness or self-admiration, as a matter of duty or common decency, is apt to be closer to the real thing.

 We can't precisely determine how and to what extent states should sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve a moral good
Luke William Hunt, 2014, Human Rights Quarterly, The Global Ethics of Helping and Harming, v. 36(4), pp. 798-819 (Luke William Hunt is on fellowship at the University of Virginia, where he is pursuing a Ph.D. focused on philosophy of law and political philosophy. Prior to beginning his doctoral studies, he completed law school and was a law clerk for Judge James P. Jones, United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He then worked at the US Department of Justice for six years.), p. 819
Indeed, the examples examined suggest that strict compliance with negative duties could be quite demanding for states. The larger point is this: Until there is a more principled account of how and to what extent a state must sacrifice its national interest in favor of positive duties to aid other states, compliance with negative duties is of central concern. The question of our moral duty to the global poor, then, may ultimately be more about the ways in which we are obligated to refrain from acting.

 Arguments about “infinite responsibility” are nonsense because we can never maintain it.
Dr John Fitzsimmons and Dr Wally Woods, Faculty of Arts, Health and Sciences at Central Queensland University, “Chapter 3 - Herman Melville's "Bartleby, the Scrivener" and "Benito Cerino," 2000, http://www.ahs.cqu.edu.au/humanities/litstud/52283/schedule/chap3/p5.htm, accessed 11/8/02
Anderson believes that the lawyer’s charity seems to go beyond what most would have given. This raises a question, he believes, which underpins the story: is it possible to perform acts of altruism without, finally, having regard to self–interest? What this suggests is that Christ’s commandments reflect an ideal, one that the rest of us find impossible to live up to because, at a certain point, we all turn back to self–preservation (that is, unlike Christ who went "all the way" and gave up his life). The contrast between capitalism (Wall Street being one of its dominant symbols) with its self–interest, and the Christ–like Bartleby could not, Anderson argues, be stronger. He concludes that the "divine–logos," which Bartleby represents, shows itself as an impossible practice within the confines of "institutionalised self–interest". Or to put it another way, if we are our brother’s keeper, Bartleby, in demanding to be kept without offering anything in return, is so exasperating that even the apparently charitable lawyer gives in and moves out when Bartleby refuses to quit his offices.

 Arguments about the importance of helping refuges do not apply when there are enormous numbers of refugees.
Michael Walzer, philosopher, 2008, Spheres Of Justice: A Defense Of Pluralism And Equality, Kindle Edition, p. 50
Since ideological (far more than ethnic) affinity is a matter of mutual recognition, there is a lot of room here for political choice— and thus, for exclusion as well as admission. Hence it might be said that my argument doesn’t reach to the desperation of the refugee. Nor does it suggest any way of dealing with the vast numbers of refugees generated by twentieth-century politics. On the one hand, everyone must have a place to live, and a place where a reasonably secure life is possible. On the other hand, this is not a right that can be enforced against particular host states. (The right can’t be enforced in practice until there is an international authority capable of enforcing it; and were there such an authority, it would certainly do better to intervene against the states whose brutal policies had driven their own citizens into exile, and so enable them all to go home.)

 AT: Prioritizing Morality in Foreign Policy
There are several arguments Pro teams should make against prioritizing morality in foreign policy.
  197

 Adopting any strong ethical code in foreign policy is dangerous
Didier Pollefeyt, Professor of Moral Theology, Katholieke Universiteit, 1999, Ethics After the Holocaust, p. 37
Second, in an important way Levinas's thought leads towards a reduction of the Jewish religion to an ethical religion. Religion is threatened in that its concerns can become exclusively a matter of ethics, that is, doing what is good. But what if the person fails, if courage falls short, and one falls into sin? An ethical God can only judge. Here the danger and terror of ethics arises. The paradox is that Nazism could also be interpreted along these lines, as becomes clear in the thought of Peter Haas. Nazism seems to be founded on a definite, ruthless (indeed perverted) "ethical" code. Nazism was in all possible respects merciless. Whoever did not comply with its "ethical" demands inevitably "deserved" to be eliminated. Of course, Levinas's ethics and Nazi ethics are fundamentally different (see my contribution to this volume), precisely because Levinas's ethics is centered on openness and Nazi ethics on closedness. But at the same time, Levinas's ethics should also be questioned as to its possibility of becoming fanatic in confrontation with evildoers. We must there- fore also put forth the question: "What comes after ethics?" The Judaeo-Christian tradition is also a tradition of mercy. Ethics can hereby be saved from its mercilessness. A persons existence can never be completely reduced to one moment. One is always more than what one has done. For ethics after Auschwitz, however, one of the most pressing questions is whether there are situations where humanity has done such great violence that we find ourselves in the ethical impossibility of forgiveness. In the case of genocide one can without the least doubt speak of him pardonable." If not, a forgiveness that is too easily granted leads once again to a trivialization of ethics. The philosophy of Levinas, in other words, should be an occasion that initiates reflection on the relationship between ethics and forgiveness.

 Moralizing has produced disastrous wars in the past.
William Pfaff, syndicated columnist, International Herald Tribune, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, January/February 2001, p.226-7
Wilsonian sentimentality has led to disastrous consequences over the past 80 years, yet these fiascoes seem to have left no trace on the minds of Wilson's modern followers. His naivete about universal national self- determination contributed to the conditions in central and eastern Europe that, in the 1930s and 1940s, invited Hitler's intervention. His influence on Franklin Roosevelt led the latter to oppose Winston Churchill's efforts to use "Power politics" in central Europe to secure it from postwar Soviet control. Wilson's legacy was also responsible for Roosevelt's belief that a new League, the United Nations, could resolve postwar geopolitical problems. Even U.S. policy in the Vietnam War was a confused amalgam of anticommunism and Wilsonian sentimentality: Lyndon Johnson justified his foreign policy as a means to give others what they "want for themselves -liberty, justice, dignity, a better life for all."And remember that was is what has caused the refugee crisis in the first place!

 People don’t elect their leaders to make value judgments – there’s no consensus about values in America (or any country) and promoting them abroad is divisive and is undemocratic.
Robert Kagan, Professor of History and Classics – Yale 1983 Washington Quarterly v.6 n.1, p. 138
Elected officials of a representative republican government, however, have no such right. While always professing a general morality, they do not run for office on the basis of a specific, declared hierarchy of moral values and judgments, but rather, at best, on a stated notion of the national interest. Certainly none has ever run on a program of subordinating the security and interests of the country to any particular view of the morality of foreign governments. Yet such a program is implicit in any policy that is shaped by the internal behavior of foreign nations. Such a policy is not only at odds with a correct understanding of representative government and impossible to follow consistently and honestly, but it would also be dangerously divisive. However much Americans may disagree on what is in their national interest, they differ far more strongly and deeply on the application of particular views of morality to foreign policy. We are a people of varied origins with vestigial attachments to the lands of our heritage. During World War I Americans of German and Irish descent felt very differently about the morality of the British blockade and of German submarine warfare than did Americans of British origin. Only attacks on American ships created a consensus that made war against Germany possible. On the eve of World War II many German-Americans and Italo-Americans were of a decidedly different view than were others of the need to fight against the wickedness of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy alongside the wickedness of communist Russia, nor were ethnic differences the only deep and important ones. Only Japan's attack on their country rallied all Americans to the common cause. Although Wilson and then Roosevelt had no doubt where virtue and iniquity lay, neither could have brought his nation into war on that basis; both had to wait until the nation's security and vital interests were obviously at stake. Even to try to do otherwise would have rent the nation into bitterly hostile factions and done it great harm. When Americans vote for presidents and members of Congress they do not think their votes give the government the right to make moral judgments for them -- only prudential ones, especially when the possibility of war exists. The losing 45 percent of more of the electorate can tolerate the winning party making practical decisions on their behalf, but not far-ranging moral ones. In a disparate, plural society moralism in foreign affairs divides, while enlightened self-interest unites.

 AT: Cosmopolitanism
Some Con teams may argue for a greater cosmopolitan ethic to look out for international interests, but there are some problems with this –
  201

 Although embracing immigration appears to embrace a cosmopolitan ethic,
including many different immigrant groups is likely to create several internal
conflicts, not a cosmopolitan ethic.
Susan Motomura, Professor of Law at UCLA, 2006, Americans in Waiting: The lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States, p. 13-14
This entire inquiry reflects my hope that national citizenship in the United States can be a viable context for a sense of belonging and for participation in civic, political, social, and economic life that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals. There are certainly other models of belonging, including transnational models that reflect a sense of belonging to more than one nation, and postnational models that think beyond national citizenship entirely. But the apparent inclusiveness of these other approaches to belonging can mask other modes of exclusion. If national citizenship matters less, ties of religion, race, class, and other groupings that are less cosmopolitan or democratic than national citizenship will matter even more than they do already. The result may be a world without national walls but also a world of a “thousand petty fortresses,” as political philosopher Michael Walzer once put it. Making national citizenship into an inclusive vehicle is not easy. It requires a welcome of immigrants—crystallized in the idea of Americans in waiting—that has faded from law and policy in the United States. Although this idea has weakened and is in danger of weakening further, it should be restored to prominent influence because it captures this basic truth: a sensible we/they line must reflect the understanding that many of them will become part of us. This understanding was the conceptual engine for integrating generations of immigrants—mostly those from Europe. With much of this understanding gone, we should not be surprised if more recent waves of immigrants, especially immigrants of color, seem more reluctant to cross the we/they line into American society. Recovering the lost story of immigrants as Americans in waiting is thus crucial not only to giving immigrants their due, but also to recovering the vision of our national future that is reflected in the phrase “a nation of immigrants”— that America is made up of immigrants, but still one nation.

 Acting to promote a cosmopolitan ethic and global human rights is likely to trigger conflict and war, not peace
Joseph S. Nye, 1986, Director, Center for Science and International Affairs, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Nuclear Ethics, p. 33
While the cosmopolitan approach has the virtue of accepting transnational realities and avoids the sanctification of the nation-state, an unsophisticated cosmopolitanism also has serious drawbacks. First, if morality is about choice, then to underestimate the significance of states and boundaries is to fail to take into account the main features of the real setting in which choices must be made. To pursue individual justice at the cost of survival or to launch human rights crusades that cannot hope to be fulfilled, yet interfere with prudential concerns about order, may lead to immoral consequences. And if such actions, for example the promotion of human rights in Eastern Europe, were to lead to crises and an unintended nuclear war, the consequences might be the ultimate immorality. Applying ethics to foreign policy is more than merely constructing philosophical arguments; it must be relevant to the international domain in which moral choice is to be exercised.
  203

 The nation-state is the only check on structural violence—cosmopolitanism is unsustainable as an alternative
Pheng Cheah, Professor of Rhetoric at UC-Berkeley, 1998, “Given Culture,” Cosmopolitics: Thinking and Feeling Beyond the Nations, 312-314
The aporia, however, is that in the current conjuncture, nationalism cannot be transcended by cosmopolitan forms of solidarity no matter how pathological it may appear in its ineradicably oppressive moments. First, transnational networks are, in and of themselves, neither mass based nor firmly politically institutionalized. Proponents of a global civil society or an international public sphere that already exists independent of nation-states must gloss over the fact that we inhabit a decentralized political system in which global loyalty is thin, an ideal vision largely confined to activists and intellectuals.43 This means that in order to be effective at the level of political institutions or the popular masses, transnational networks have to work with and through the nation-state in order to transform it. They have to negotiate directly with the state in the hope of influencing its political morality and/or mobilize local support into popular national movements that press against the state. As Alexander Colas observes, the nation-state is both a constraining factor and an emancipatory potential in its relation to global networks. Global networks are subject to the same constraining social and historical forces that shape other social actors, but "the nation-state is not necessarily at odds with the emancipatory aspirations of cosmopolitanism... [and] cosmopolitan political action would actually involve the defense of social and political rights via the democratic nation-state."44 Second, the necessity of the nation-state as a terminal that progressive global-local networks must pass through is especially salient in the postcolonial South, where economic poverty is the root cause of economic, social, and political oppression. Although foreign capital-led market growth and development may alleviate poverty when actively regulated by strong host governments to serve official national interests, such as in high-growth Southeast Asia, high economic growth cannot lead to social development or gender equity unless the existing inequitable sociopolitical-economic structures within these nation-states are overhauled. Indeed, high growth may provide greater legitimation to authoritarian regimes, as in the case of Singapore. In the worst-case scenario, as in some African nations, we have the development of underdevelopment that produces the Fourth World. The point is that in the absence of a world-state capable of ensuring an equitable international political and economic order, economic globalization is uneven. Instead of engendering an emancipatory cosmopolitan consciousness, globalization produces a polarized world in which bourgeois national development and industrialization in the periphery are necessarily frustrated by state adjustment to the dictates of transnational Capital. To alleviate the shortfalls of global restructuring in the South, the state needs to be an autonomous agent of economic accumulation. But the state can resist capitulation to trans-national forces only if it is transformed from a comprador regime into a popular national-state. This is why popular rearticulations of postcolonial nation- al identity are ethically imperative and cannot be dismissed per se as statist ideologies that hinder the rise of a more equitable cosmopolitan consciousness, even though the exclusionary dimension of popular nationalism can always be manipulated by state elites and captured by official nationalism. Contemporary revivals of postcolonial nationalism that are primarily instances of negative identification in defense against neocolonial globalization should therefore be seen as weak repetitions of the earlier phase of negative identification in decolonization that initially united the people into a nation. This ambivalent necessity of postcolonial nationalism deforms the concept of cultural agency at the heart of old and new cosmopolitanisms. In Marx's version of the culture-concept of philosophical modernity, economic forces of production constitute an autotelic realm of necessity that points beyond itself to a realm of human freedom from the given—the proletarian world community—based on, but sublating, the realm of necessity. The urgency of postcolonial nationalism in contemporary globalization, however, refutes Marx's economistic assumption that transnational forces of production necessarily lead to transnational movements that engender mass-based loyalty to a transnational body or a popular global consciousness. In his critique of orthodox Marxist cosmopolitanism, Samir Amin points out that peripheralization and the North-South conflict are the two truths of really existing capitalism. He argues that socialist revolution is
  204

 not possible in the current conjuncture because "the expansion of capitalism in the periphery . . . ruins the chances of national crystallization and accentuates the fragmentation and atomization of society."46 Consequently, he sug- gests that there is "no real alternative to popular national transformation in the societies of the periphery" (SM, 124) and that African and Asian popular nationalist-socialism are inheritors of the true vocation of Marxism.47 In his vision of a polycentric world, Amin rejects the orthodox Marxistcosmopolitanist idea of the withering away of the state because strong post-colonial states, and hence popular nationalism, are crucial to resist recom- pradorization (SM, 127). Put another way, postcolonial nationalism is the irreducible stuttering that the permanent threat of peripheralization introduces into the dialectic of global socialism. Therefore, contrary to neo-Marxist critiques of postcolonial nationalism such as Partha Chatterjee's and Ranajit Guha's, postcolonial nationalism is not necessarily an ideology imposed from above, a "forced resolution . . . of the contradiction between capital and the people-nation."48 Postcolonial nationalism is not a contradiction that we can and ought to transcend in the name of a cosmopolitanism, because it does not obey the logic of dialectical contradiction. Both medicine and poison, postcolonial nationalism is a double-edged stricture that, instead of being transcended, is made necessary by neocolonial globalization. By pulling us back from a cosmopolitical realm of freedom into nationalism as given culture, globalization problematizes the Marxist understanding of the given as something we can transcend through normative human action.

 Resettling refugees doesn’t really help. Even resettling a lot more won’t solve the problem
Nalysa Rush, Center for Immigration Studies, August 7, 2018, Refugee Resettlement Lifeline or Foreign Policy tool,
Kay Bellor, vice president with Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services (another volag), also worried about the consequences of lower resettlement numbers on hosting countries; in the words of the Politico report, Bellor feared that "refugees could be stranded in host countries such as Turkey and Lebanon if the U.S. doesn't open its doors." She believes, like Nezer above, this sends a "terrible signal" to host countries: "It's hard to imagine how this might impact their response." [Emphases added.]
What is hard to imagine is the following: How is resettling a few thousand out of millions of "stranded refugees" going to significantly impact hosting countries, not to mention "stabilize" them?
Resettlement, a few drops in the ocean
Let's focus on the region Bellor refers to, host to millions of Syrian refugees. In fiscal year 2016, the Obama administration resettled 35,555 refugees from the Near East/South Asia region (a region that includes Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan). Of those, 12,587 were Syrians. (See Refugee Processing Center numbers for October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016.)
Most registered Syrian refugees in the region are hosted in the following countries, according to UNHCR data: 3.5 million in Turkey, close to 1 million in Lebanon, and close to 700,000 in Jordan. Other estimates are much higher.
So, in FY 2016, at the height of Syrian refugee admissions under President Obama, the United States resettled 0.2 percent of the 5.2 million there. Yet refugee advocates want us to believe that such small-scale resettlement (or the lack thereof) is a foreign policy game-changer. Even if these numbers were to double, triple, or more, the reality is that the effect of resettlement both real and symbolic on host countries is minimal, akin to rain drops in the ocean.
Oxford economist Paul Collier concurs:
Migration to the West is a peripheral aspect of what to do when there's a conflict ... Look, the refugees overwhelmingly are and are going to continue to be in countries that border the areas of the conflicts, so the fate of refugees does not really depend on whether a few thousand more come to the rich societies. What matters is what happens to the millions. [Emphasis added.]
Concerns of hosting states: Help the millions here and set the pace for refugee return
Following the Syrian refugee crisis that affected millions, Collier and a colleague, Oxford refugee scholar Alexander Betts, wrote about a failing international refugee policy:
To properly care for the displaced, policymakers must first understand the concerns of the states that host them. An effective refugee policy should improve the lives of the refugees in the short term and the prospects of the region in the long term, and it should also serve the economic and security interests of the host states.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun is clear about what his country needs, and it's not resettlement of a handful of the refugees hosted by his country to the West. Aoun saw Lebanon's unemployment rate climb to an unprecedented 46 percent with the presence of 1.86 million Syrian refugees on its soil. (The number is Aoun's estimate.) "Today, The United Nations thanks us for our humanity in dealing with the Syrian refugees," Aoun said. But as he told EU official Johannes Hahn, such thanks "do not feed bread" to the refugees. "You have to resolve the refugee case before we ourselves become refugees," he said. Syrian refugees now make up over a quarter of Lebanon's population.
207
  
 Lebanon has been pushing for Syrian refugees to return to safe areas in Syria, a move UNHCR deems unsafe. The relationship between Lebanese officials and UNHCR turned sour lately, with Lebanon accusing the UN refugee agency of purposely discouraging Syrian refugees from returning home.
Gratitude and/or resettlement have little bearing on hosting countries. What the Lebanese government (and most likely other host governments in the region) wants is financial aid to ease the impact of refugee presence on their economy, education, environment, health system, etc. The top priority remains working towards refugee return.
Trump: A more efficient refugee policy to help millions and their hosting countries
In his first address to the UN General Assembly, President Trump explained the U.S. approach to the current refugee crisis:
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process... Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.
The United States is, according to a government fact sheet, the "world's leading donor of humanitarian assistance for the Syria crisis, providing nearly $7.7 billion throughout Syria and the region since the start of the conflict in March 2011."
Even as the resettlement ceiling was lowered, President Trump has always been an advocate for proximity help, as he told Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri last year: "Our approach, supporting the humanitarian needs of displaced Syrian citizens as close to their home country as possible, is the best way to help most people."
Trump is also said to be considering plans for the safe return of Syrian refugees to their country.
Lastly, if we were to concede to refugee advocates that resettlement is a foreign policy tool, does this mean that UNHCR, already entrusted with resettlement referrals, is now also in charge of implementing U.S. foreign policy and "stabilizing countries that are hosting the refugees"? As the French would say, rien que a! (is that all?)

 US cuts irrelevant to the global refugee problem
Gillman Friedman, DesReuters, July 20, 2018 Friday, Refugees in U.S. drop sharply, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-pompeo/u-s-to-sharply-limit-refugee-flows-to-30000-in-2019- idUSKCN1LX2HS
To explain the sharp decline, Darrow and Allen point to what they call the Trump administration's hostility to refugee resettlement, which was a cornerstone of President Donald Trump's presidential campaign and has remained a central theme of his time in office. The administration has slashed the refugee ceiling for fiscal 2018 to 45,000 people - the lowest in five decades - and has banned travel to the U.S. from five countries with majority Muslim populations. "These policies send the message that people who are fleeing for their very lives are not welcome here," says Darrow. "The data provides evidence of the administration's efforts to limit the welcome we offer to the world's most vulnerable populations." The decline in refugee resettlement comes at a time when the global refugee population reached a "peak" in 2017 at 19.9 million, according to Phillip Connor, Pew senior researcher and one of the authors of the study. The consequences Practically speaking, says Allen, the decline will have very little effect on individual refugees seeking a new home. That's because less than 1 percent of the total number of displaced people in the world will ever be resettled, and the U.S. resettles only a small fraction of that 1 percent. Out of a total of nearly 20 million refugees worldwide in 2017, just 103,000 were resettled, according to Pew. "The United States taking a step back isn't going to have a dramatic effect on refugees worldwide because such a small percentage of refugees are resettled anyway," Allen says, comparing the chances of being resettled to "winning a lottery ticket."

 Trump won’t effectively exercise refugee leadership
Martin and Aleinikoff 18 -- Martin is professor emerita at Georgetown University and Aleinikoff is director of the Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility at the New School (Susan and T. Alexander, “Without US leadership, what is the future for refugees and migrants?” Andrew & Renata Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, 05/13/2018, http://www.kaldorcentre.unsw.edu.au/news/without-us-leadership-what-future-refugees-and-migrants)
The US is present at the consultations on the refugee compact, but the Trump administration refused to even enter
negotiations on the migration compact. This is counter-productive. The US should return to the migration negotiating table and work to ensure that both compacts reach their full potential. The aims of the refugee compact are to: improve responsibility-sharing; strengthen national protection systems and international responses that safeguard refugees’ rights; enhance social and economic conditions for refugees and host communities; and resolve protracted limbo for refugees through
real, durable solutions. To achieve these aims, the compact proposes several new structures for international cooperation, including the convening of global refugee summits and global support platforms for particular refugee situations – efforts for which US leadership will be key. The migration compact is about improving cooperation on international migration. It recognizes that no State – even one as powerful as the United States – can
manage international migration unilaterally. As it pulled out of the negotiations, the Trump administration cited concerns about losing sovereignty. But cooperation with others can enhance sovereignty, by ensuring that all countries play by the same rules and thereby are better able to protect their borders. At the same time, the migration compact holds great potential for better protecting the rights of migrants and ensuring their safety. So the US would enhance its security, as
other countries commit to work with the US to prevent the conditions that cause mass movements, to receive back their
citizens who migrate through irregular channels, and to ensure that more migration is through safe, orderly and regular
programs. This is not to say that the current drafts cannot be improved. As we propose in Making the Global Compacts Work, a detailed policy brief newly released by UNSW's Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, the refugee compact should be more explicit in addressing barriers that prevent refugees from finding safety; propose new mechanisms to boost funding for the immediate and long-term needs of refugees and their host communities; provide ways for refugees to participate in decisions about their own future; support enhanced refugee mobility; and focus more specifically on protracted refugee situations which have defied long-term solutions. The migration compact should set out more clearly the purpose of the document and its foundational vision and principles; acknowledge more prominently the beneficial role that migrants play in the development of both source and destination countries; recognize the importance of migration other than for employment, including for family reunification, education, trade and investment; and be more explicit in defining areas of migrant vulnerability, whether these are demographic, socio-economic, or situational (for example, those stranded in transit countries). Both compacts need to ensure there are clear, robust mechanisms for monitoring
progress and holding governments accountable for their commitments. And both should address gaps between the two compacts – most importantly, how the
international community responds to people fleeing life-threatening situations, including natural disasters, but who do not qualify under law as either labor migrants or as refugees. Their protection remains at risk today.We are cautiously optimistic that the two global compacts will be adopted. Political leadership will be needed, however. That is the real power that ensures other countries follow through on their commitments. That is what enables the UN system to protect and find solutions for refugees and provide a safe, orderly system of regular migration. It is deeply unfortunate that the US is not exercising its traditional leadership role—a failure that undermines the promise and potential of the compacts. Fortunately, other countries appear willing to continue consulting and negotiating compacts that should enhance protection and find solutions for refugees and migrants. We wish them well.

 US credibility is unrecoverable under Trump and US diplomacy is hollowed out
Byman, 18 - Daniel Byman is foreign policy editor of Lawfare. He is a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, where he focuses on counterterrorism and Middle East security. He is also a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. (“Recovering From the Trump Foreign Policy” Lawfare, 6/14, https://www.lawfareblog.com/recovering-trump-foreign-policy,
Some repairs, while extensive, may still be easy. Even if Trump’s successor favors a more traditional foreign policy, however, he or she cannot simply sweep the Trump administration under a rug and resume the previous course. The United States has lost influence with allies and is squandering much of its “soft power” in ways that will make it difficult to regain. One of the biggest challenges, and one discussed in detail by my Brookings colleague Thomas Wright and other experts, is Trump’s retreat from the world order the United States created and championed after World War II—a retreat also seen in the United Kingdom, Italy and other parts of the world. One can point to many fits and starts, but in general both Republican and Democratic administrations advanced free trade, U.S.-led alliances and international institutions, while Trump has scorned all three. A successor to Trump can try to renew these commitments but must do so with the world recognizing that a sizeable share of Americans oppose these traditional components of the world order and that a leader championing these Americans might again gain power. In addition, Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran deal after years of painstaking negotiations shows that the United States will not necessarily honor its commitments: It is an administration that is making a deal apparently. The shadow of the future is far grimmer, as a commitment that binds one administration may no longer bind its successors. Some parts of the world are wrestling with a longer-term retreat of American power. Europe and the Middle East began this process under President Obama, who was not eager for the United States to play a heavy role in shaping these regions. The bottom for U.S. influence fell out under Trump, who has repeatedly scorned the NATO alliance and blasted European allies as feckless freeloaders who owe the United States “massive amounts of money” for their defense. A Politbarometer poll taken in May found that only 14 percent of Germans consider America a reliable partner: Russia scored 36 percent and China 43 percent. Given Russia’s aggressiveness, however, a future U.S. leader may want to reverse course and at least some European states might look for help, but allies will rightly question whether the United States will be by their side and stay there. And as the next administration wrestles with a more skeptical world, it will have to do so with a hollowed-out diplomatic corps. Congress has long viewed State Department budget requests with skepticism, and under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson the Trump administration sought massive budget cuts while purging veteran diplomats and freezing hiring. His successor, Mike Pompeo, has pledged to end the orgy of institutional destruction and, commendably, has taken several steps to do so. But institutions cannot be rebuilt overnight. The talent loss has been severe, and the chaos in the White House is scaring away competent professionals. Some diplomats worry about the abandonment of any human rights agenda and the shift in power from State to the Pentagon.

 Trump collapses international law---US leadership is unsustainable
Goldsmith, 17 – Henry L. Shattuck Professor at Harvard Law School, co-founder of Lawfare, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, previously an Assistant Attorney General and Special Cousel to the Department of Defense (Jack, “The Trump Onslaught on International Law and Institutions,” Lawfare, 3/17/17, https://www.lawfareblog.com/trump- onslaught-international-law-and-institutions) //
Two months into the Trump administration, we are witnessing the beginnings of the greatest presidential onslaught on international law and international institutions in American history. The onslaught appears to be driven by a combination of economic nationalism, anti-cosmopolitanism, anti-elitism, a belief that international law does not reflect American values but threatens American institutions, and a related belief that “American peace, prestige, and prosperity were not being served by our foreign policy.” I don’t think the onslaught will succeed on its own terms, but I do think it will be consequential—for international law and institutions, and for America’s role in the world. What follows is an outline of what we know so far about the onslaught, as well as some modest predictions along the way, and at the end. Gutting State Department capacity The State Department runs U.S. diplomacy and oversees the operation of U.S. international agreements. The Trump administration is trying to gut State Department capacity across the board. This is evident in its proposal to cut sharply the State Department and USAID budgets, in its failure to nominate (much less get confirmed) anyone yet for senior Department posts other than Secretary of State Tillerson, in the general slowdown of State Department operations, in Tillerson’s very low-key tenure thus far, and in its proposal to kill a number of State Department initiatives and funds, including the Global Climate Change, the Green and Strategic Climate Funds, the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund, and the East-West Center. It is unclear at this point precisely how a reduction of State Department capacity will impact U.S. international law commitments and U.S. participation and influence in international institutions. But Tillerson wrote to State Department employees yesterday, the budget cuts are “an unmistakable restatement of the needs the country faces and the priorities we must establish.” Eliminating domestic agencies related to international relations The Trump budget also proposes to eliminate numerous domestic agencies outside the State Department related to international law and relations, including African Development Foundation, the Inter-American Foundation, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corp., the U.S. Institute of Peace, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and the International Food for Education program. Slow-down, or halt, in new international agreements The writing has been on the wall for new international agreements ever since President Trump formally abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the third day of his presidency. A few days later a draft Executive Order, Moratorium on New Multilateral Treaties, leaked. The EO was only a draft, and it is limited to Article II treaties, which form only a sliver of U.S. international agreements. (It’s not clear if the Trump Team realizes that treaties are rare.) But even if it never sees the light of say, the draft EO reveals the thinking of some senior officials in the Trump White House. The purpose of the draft EO is “to prevent the making of any new treaties—other than treaties that are clearly appropriate matters of international concern, such as treaties implicating national security, extradition, and international trade—until a high-level executive branch committee has had an opportunity to review and assess the treaty.” The draft EO would place a moratorium on most new treaties except upon an inter-agency Treaty Committee’s review and recommendation (a process that apparently comes on top of the usual Circular 175 process). The explanatory statement of the draft EO picks out the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Rights of the Child Convention as treaties used “to force countries to often radical domestic agendas that could not, themselves, otherwise be enacted in accordance with a country’s domestic laws.” It’s thus not looking so good for these treaties in the next four years, or for other human rights treaties, or for other even slightly controversial multilateral treaties (including the Law of the Sea Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity.) For various reasons, President Obama both sent treaties to the Senate and received Senate consent at historically low rates. We should expect the Trump administration’s rate to be even lower, perhaps much lower. Indeed, I would not be surprised if the Trump administration declined to send to the Senate the usual Treaty Priority List. Finally, expect relevant treaties that make it through the Senate to have historically robust non-self-execution declarations and federalism clauses. Increase in termination of international agreements President Trump has already threatened to unwind or terminate the Iran Deal (i.e. the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), the Paris Agreement, and NAFTA. This will be
                         213
 
 harder to do than he thinks. It is in theory easy for the United States to walk away from its part of the Iran Deal, which rests at its foundation on presidential waivers of domestic sanctions that President Trump can reverse. But this might be politically hard to do since the United States cannot re-establish the global sanctions regime and any reimposition of unilateral action might hurt U.S. companies more than anyone else. Certain elements of the Paris Deal establish binding international commitments, though the key provision on emissions reduction is legally non-binding. It is unclear whether President Trump will try to terminate the agreement itself, or simply violate the non-binding commitment to reduce emissions, which would involve unwinding the domestic Clean Power Plan (the latter of which would likely trigger significant domestic litigation). As for NAFTA, it is an ex post congressional-executive agreements embedded in domestic law. No president (to my knowledge) has every unilaterally terminated such an agreement, and it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to do so. While all three of these threatened high-profile terminations are thus uncertain, I expect Trump to try to kill or undermine at least some of them, and also to terminate less prominent treaties and agreements for symbolic purposes if nothing else. We will, I expect, learn a lot about the law of treaty and agreement termination—a topic almost bereft of judicial guidance—in the coming years. Disengagement from international organizations Early in the administration a draft Executive Order titled Auditing and Reducing U.S. Funding of International Organizations leaked. Like the draft on new treaties, this one has not become final. But the Trump administration has made clear its plans to reduce funding or disengage from from international organizations. Secretary of Defense Mattis threatened to reduce NATO funding unless NATO allies pony up. Secretary of State Tillerson has threatened to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council absent “considerable reform.” The Trump budget would reduce or kill funding to a number of United Nations programs, including “eliminating pledged payments to U.N. climate- change programs, and reducing funding for U.N. peacekeeping missions.” Trump won’t get all of his cuts, but the prospects for U.S. funding for and participation in many international organizations looks bleak. Disengagement from international courts Don’t expect the next four years to be happy times for U.S. engagement with international courts either. The Trump administration has not said anything specific on this topic. But it easy to imagine the administration refusing to participate in the current case brought by Iran in the International Court of Justice—especially if the United States loses on jurisdiction. A refusal to participate accompanied by a bit of Iran-bashing and ICJ-bashing would be just the type of easy-to-accomplish, highly symbolic anti-international law move that the Trump Team appears to like. Expect similarly poor relations with the International Criminal Court, especially if the prosecutor there opens a full investigation against Israel or of senior Bush officials concerning activities in Afghanistan. The Obama and late Bush administrations supported ICC prosecutions and gave assistance to the ICC prosecutor, and the Obama administration participated in an observer capacity in the ICC Assembly of States Parties (ASP). The Trump administration won’t support the ICC in any way and may withdraw even from observer status in the ASP. Finally, I think we can expect somewhat greater presidential resistance to WTO dispute resolution decisions than in the past. De-emphasis on international human rights law in U.S. foreign policy President Obama has been criticized in some circles for his poor human rights record. Expect President Trump to be much worse for the international human rights movement. Trump’s rhetoric on topics ranging from torture to immigration to Islam have already been seen as a major setback for international human rights. “Donald Trump’s election as US president after a campaign fomenting hatred and intolerance,” in combination with the rise of the right in Europe, has “put the postwar human rights system at risk,” said Human Rights Watch in the introduction to its 2017 World Report. One sign of the Trump administration's attitude toward international human rights: In a breach of tradition, neither Secretary of State Tillerson nor anyone else at the State Department appeared in person to introduce the recent rollout of the Department’s annual human rights report.

Adoption of the compact, is “not the end, but the beginning” of the international community’s work on the issue, general Assembly President, Maria Fernanda Espinosa declared. What’s left is implementation. Echoing the call to further action, Mr. Grandi warned that the compact on refugees “is not a silver bullet that will solve all the problems,” but with concrete international engagement, could “be transformative.” “Without this international cooperation we will not be able to face neither this all the other global challenges that await us in the future,” he added.

 Global Compact on Refugees fails
Thai News Service, September 20, , World: Global Compact on Refugees - a rich countries' model for keeping others out | View
The UN General Assembly is set to vote on the final draft of the global compact on refugees as a basis for a more equitable sharing of the burden and responsibility for hosting and supporting the world's refugees. The compact is, however, largely a rich countries' model designed to protect their borders from unwanted refugees. The outcome will be less protection and more death, as refugees will continue to risk their lives to reach security in the global north. Privatising refugee protection The compact demonstrates a risky pattern of privatising refugee protection, shifting the responsibility away from the state to the private sector. Its market-driven approach results in a further privatisation of protection and the substitution of insecure private sector ventures for guaranteed public sector commitments. The increasing reliance on the private sector, foreign investment, and support from the World Bank and similar international agencies reduces the guarantees, predictability, and the regularity that are usually expected from states and the public sector. In this market-driven structure, the global compact has created a model of refugee protection in the spirit of the dominant neoliberal paradigm. The privatisation of service delivery in rich countries in recent years resulted in labour abuses, price increases, reduction in access, and other problems. Relying on the private sector for delivering refugee protection promises similar failures and access crises. Refugees and their rights, and their protection needs are left to the economic calculus of private employers and the laws of markets. For example, the compact seeks labour mobility for refugees, including through the identification of refugees with skills that are needed in third countries. In doing so, it practically turns the refugees into de facto economic migrants, reduces protection into access to jobs, and strips refugees of the possibility of resettlement through asylum. This market-based effort to help the refugees that might meet labour markets demands and fit the economic calculus of foreign employers leaves out any possibility of permanent residence, or citizenship for the refugees accepted as labour migrants. The fate of the chosen few refugees will squarely depend on their continuing luck to meet the requirements of the ever-evolving flexible labour markets. The compact is silent on the future of these refugees once their jobs are terminated due to markets considerations. International division of labour in refugee protection The compact institutionalises an unequal international division of labour in refugee protection by keeping refugees at bay and warehousing them in current host countries. Currently, the global south hosts 85% of the world refugees under UNHCR's mandate. Subjected to a myriad of economic, social, and other insecurities, refugees face varying, and in many cases severe, protection deficits. Addressing this deficit through predictable burden and responsibility sharing was seemingly the driving force behind the global compact on refugee protection. Many hoped for a change in the international division of labour for refugee protection through the spatial reallocation of refugees (resettlement) and other meaningful schemes. However, the agreed compact reinforces the old spatial arrangement. Current host countries are asked to continue providing the space and the bulk of the resources for refugee protection. Rich countries help through development aid, preferential trade agreements, private sector investment, and similar measures. There is little room for spatial reallocation of refugees. The compact's proposed development aid to current host states is designed to stop the future movement of refugees to rich countries in the West. Many have challenged the usefulness of development aid in reducing migration. The model suffers from a faulty understanding of protection, and the causes of refugee's continuing movement. Jobs in current host countries are indeed important for refugee protection. As research shows, access to jobs, however, does not stop refugees' movement if they lack a sense of overall security and still believe they can reach the desired threshold of safety elsewhere in the world. While promoting increased economic involvement of the private sector in securing employment for refugees in current host countries, the compact largely ignores refugees' labour rights. The omission risks turning refugees into cheap and unprotected labour for private enterprises and large transnational corporations. It subordinates refugee rights to the rationality of market relations and impersonal economic calculus. Jobs matter. Regular jobs with a living wage matter more. Renewable or regular residence permit are crucial for refugees. Citizenship in a safe country that provides a secure and sustainable life for refugee families matter more. Political instability and the lack of human rights and civil liberties continue to motivate many refugees to move. Once displaced by war, conflict, or other calamities and insecurities, refugees would continue to move till they reach their desired and projected zone of security.
